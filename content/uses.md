As a software engineering manager and developer I use a lot of tools in my daily work. This page is my attempt to document those tools in hopes that maybe someone will find them useful as well as simply to keep track of them for myself.

## My Use Case

So what do I use this all for? I tend to think our use cases are just as important as the tools themselves. For instance, I wouldn't recommend some of my own tools to someone just starting out in code or who is only writing code for themselves. How we use our tools defines, or at least probably should define, the tools we use so here are my own use cases.

*   **Software Engineering Manager** – My day job requires me to communicate with my team and the wider organization for mentoring, guidance and strategy.
*   **Software Developer** – I love building software and have been doing so for my work and my hobbies for as long as I can remember. As time has gone by my tooling in this has changed considerably and the tools listed below are those I use to build and maintain the projects I am currently working on, both personally and professionally.
*   **Blogger** – I love writing on this site and dream of spending a lot of time both on content as well as the site itself. This role encompasses creating content and writing code to share solutions to problems I’ve encountered in hopes that they’ll be just as helpful to others as they were to me.
*   **Teacher/Speaker** – Though I’ve done less of this since 2020, I still very much enjoy speaking and teaching at conferences and other events.
*   **Human** – While the last one might seem obvious it is clear that most of tech doesn’t agree. As a human I want tech that respects my rights and actually works for me instead of trying to force my use case into its features (or lack thereof).

## My Hardware


![My current desk configuration with 2 laptops and designed for balancing work and non-work projects.](/images/2024/02/my-current-office-setup.jpeg)

I built my home office over my 11 years of working fully remote. It is still my sanctuary, if you will, and where I spend a lot of time on projects, both personally and professionally. In our new place it’s tiny, not much bigger than a cubicle, and that is perfect for me, especially with the right furniture.

## My Software

![Screenshot of the launcher screen from my Mac](/images/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-02-at-10.39.03.jpg)

Historically my software has been as minimal as possible. Lately that's changed a bit but I still try my best to not replace default apps that will handle my workflow just fine. I do still, however, have work to do across a number of devices for both my personal and professional work so this list tends to be a bit longer than I would sometimes like.
