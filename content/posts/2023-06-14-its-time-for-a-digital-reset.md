This past weekend I did something I hadn’t done in a while: I “reset” as much of my only presence as possible.

I deleted my music library, cleared out my Mastodon account, deleted all my notes, web history, reminders, past calendar events, web and call histories and so much more.

I used to do this regularly, which could definitely become a problem and I hadn’t done anything like it in over a year but it was time and I’m glad I did.

So far this week I find myself less worried about things that, frankly, I didn’t need to worry about and that’s a very good thing. It was so good, in fact, that I’m debating doing it with my physical spaces including my office.

We’ll see how far that gets.
