The other day [I wrote about being back on the iPhone for a year now][1]. For now, iPhone works for me. It isn't my first choice though.

iPhone is over-priced, closed off and far too intrusive for my privacy. That said, I have no good alternative. This leaves me wondering what would make the perfect phone today? If I could have any features at all, what would they be?

## The perfect phone is no phone at all

The perfect phone is an impossible wish as to me the perfect phone would be no phone at all?

Why do I still need a phone? Because I still leave the house and, at some point, I would like to go back to travel.

At one point in my life I could stop in nearly any store and buy a local map. I could plan ahead for things like meals and attractions with a good guide book and I didn't have to worry about occupying every minute.

Those days are long past and, because of that I still have to have a phone because we've made it so that any and every solution to a problem while traveling requires a phone to function.

If I want to get from the airport to my hotel I need a ride share app (at least in most cities). If I want to check in to anything I need to do so on an app or mobile website. If I want a map a paper one might not even exist if I don't order it weeks in advance.

Because of this need to travel the perfect phone doesn't exist for me. It is for that reason that I consider the iPhone as good enough for what I need today.
