I wish I had more words, or maybe it's more courage, to talk about what I think of some of the communities I've been involved with over the years but I'm long past that.

Time and time again people show their true colors. I'm ashamed to admit it took me far too long to understand it but that hasn't been the case for some time.

I've watched, time and time again, as the worst people are accepted by the same organizations and communities that will also take literally no precautions for those who are immunocompromised or otherwise not completely abled and it re-affirms my decision to walk away.

I don't know where this path is going but I know I will keep my dignity while following it and that makes it worth it.
