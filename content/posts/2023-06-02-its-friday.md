I feel like this is a common post lately and I'm not OK with that but... what can we do?

It's Friday, at least it is was when I hit publish on this anyway. I've made it through another week without any energy at all left and that's about all I can say about it.

My mom would've turned 74 today, had she not passed in April and that combined with a busier week than usual has me at an even greater loss for words than normal.

Have a great weekend, y'all. I'll see you next week.
