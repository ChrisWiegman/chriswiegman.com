There hasn't been a lot for me to be positive about lately. Even my [office upgrade last week][1] has brought me, so far, nothing but frustration as so many things have gone wrong with the tech.

For all the frustrations though, there are some things to be positive about.

At work we're doing All Hands this week and kickoff our Hackathon tomorrow.

On our morning walks we've been seeing plenty of new birds and other wildlife as of late.

Finally, this afternoon my favorite soccer team, Everton, won their fixture and secured safety from relegation.

None of these things are huge events for most but, at least to me, they're just the little things that give me something positive to reflect on. Here's to hoping you have something positive in your own life.
