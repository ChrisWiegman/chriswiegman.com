It's one thing to "just push publish" on a blog post. I've gotten pretty good at that over the years. It's another to do so, at least for me, on code. I'm getting really close to releasing a side project I've been working on for a few months but, rather than release it, I keep finding new ways to refine it.

Call it imposter syndrome or call it something else but I can definitely say that I always fear putting new code out into the public. That's been the case for a long time but I do think that being in technical communities makes it more difficult.

I'll get there, I think. Knowing why we find such things difficult is, in my opinion, a valuable piece of knowledge. As I've gotten good at posting here on this site 3 times a week I find it fascinating that I can't publish code that I've worked on for months. That is something I need to work on.
