I flew back to Florida yesterday morning after 6 weeks and 2 days in the Chicago area.

I'd like to say I'm happy to be home but that would be a massive lie.

I'm happy to see my wife and our pets again but that's where any good part of it ends.

With a little luck that will be the last flight I ever have to take to Florida. Now to work on getting out of here. My only fear is my wife keeps coming up with excuses for why we can't and I'm starting to really worry that she won't leave here, even if I do. That scares the hell out of me.
