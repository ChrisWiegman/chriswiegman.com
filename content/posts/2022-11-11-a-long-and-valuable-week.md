It’s the end of a very long but valuable week.

At work we did an internal release push for a project that we actually released at the end of October after working on for nearly a year. That felt great. That it was a re-release of something a previous team had built, and is already converting many critics of the old version, has been even better.

On a personal note I’ve taken yesterday and today off of work (something I had scheduled long before the release) for my parents’ first visit to our home since before COVID. We’re not doing anything super fancy but it is nice to just sit and visit with them and I am very grateful for the opportunity to do so.

Of course their visit coincides with something they’re not as used to, Hurricane Nicole, which hit overnight and is passing just north of us as I actually write this.

It’s been a memorable, long and valuable week but I wouldn’t trade it for the world.
