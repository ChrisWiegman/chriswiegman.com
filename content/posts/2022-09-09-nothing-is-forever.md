As I write this I can't help but think of the death of the queen of England, which was announced a few hours ago. The idea that a single person could rule over anything for 70 years, nearly the lifespan of my retired parents, is amazing. I have no love for the concept of monarchy in general but the length of her reign is still an amazing feet.

What does this have to do with a WordPress developer?

A lot actually.

It is a reminder that nothing is eternal, even in the digital world. We spend a lot of time trying to make sure our words and work will last "forever" yet little of what I or anyone I know writes will still be read in 70 years time.

As someone who has fought with perfectionism for a very long time it is a reminder that "done" is better that "perfect." Nothing is permanent, not even in the digital world yet words or software that go unpublished will never have the chance to be anything at all.
