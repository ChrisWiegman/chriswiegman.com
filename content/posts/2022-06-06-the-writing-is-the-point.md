I find myself waffling on my writing a lot lately. I can build a solid streak for a few weeks where words and topics just flow but then I hit weeks like now where even the topics I want to write about seem impossible to tackle.

In the past I've wondered if these are the times I should just give up blogging in general. My rational is always something along the lines of asking "what is the point?"

The point, as I need to remind myself regularly, is simply to write. If it's easy, great. If it's hard, that's probably even better. I'm not here for fame or fortune, I'm here to share what I can, even the struggles around writing itself. That's how I'll get better at it over time.
