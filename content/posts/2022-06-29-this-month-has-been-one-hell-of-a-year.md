It's been a very long June.

What started with so much hope for me to number of tasks has left me, instead, with far more unfinished tasks than I started with.

From time to focus on writing to time to work on my own code to time to finish renewing my flight instructor certificate, it all pretty much fell apart.

This month has been one hell of a year.
