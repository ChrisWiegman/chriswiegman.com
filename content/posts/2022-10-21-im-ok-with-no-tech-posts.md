I often wonder if I should be posting more tech content. For a long time I avoided, at least as much as possible, personal posts of any kind on this site but that is clearly no longer the case.

Today, instead of searching for tech subjects to write about, I just want to write and I want to write as authentically as possible.

While I confess I still self-censor some topics, mostly to avoid being negative about people or organizations, I like to think the one thing I offer here is authenticity. I try to be honest about my struggles and what I’m doing about them and I’m happy with those results.

That’s not to say I won’t write about tech again but, at least for now, if just doesn’t seem like the right thing to do and, for once, I’m OK with that.
