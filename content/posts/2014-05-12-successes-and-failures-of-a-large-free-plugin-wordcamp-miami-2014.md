Yesterday I had the honor and the privilege of talking about the history of Better WP Security (now [iThemes Security](http://wordpress.org/plugins/better-wp-security/)) at WordCamp Miami 2014. While it was a short talk, I hopefully gave folks a few ideas on not only what helped me build momentum with the project but also what some of the mistakes I made along the way. Check out my slides below.

As humbling as talking about my experience with Better WP Security an even more humbling moment came later yesterday afternoon when I had the honor of joining Syed Balkhi, Matt Medeiros, Chris Lema, Nathan Hangen and Diane Kinney for a WordPress business Q&A panel. Watch for it soon on [WordPress.tv](http://wordpress.tv).
