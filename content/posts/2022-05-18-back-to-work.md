Yesterday I went back to work after having been on vacation since 6 May.

The first day back, no matter how much you like your job, is always a bit difficult. For me I spent most of the day playing catch-up and trying to figure out what all I missed. Those are never fun tasks.

Fun or not, the vacation time was absolutely worth it. As a culture we need to normalize taking more time off, both for our own sake and that of our coworkers. This is a lesson I've spent a long time trying to learn. Here's to hoping you don't make the same mistake.
