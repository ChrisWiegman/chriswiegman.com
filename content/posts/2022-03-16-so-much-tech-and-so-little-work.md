We often treat tech as it is somehow going to magically make our projects successful or even just finish them from whatever state they're in. I've been guilty of this plenty myself with thoughts such as "if I just get this new [insert device here] I'll be able to do [x]" and I think most of y'all who read this can probably say the same thing.

Everything we're sold in our modern world is sold to us as a complete solution for a problem that may or may not even exist yet nearly all of it, especially in tech, is nothing but tools to, hopefully, enable us to solve our own problems.

This is a lesson I still need to learn well, but something I'm striving to do better at.
