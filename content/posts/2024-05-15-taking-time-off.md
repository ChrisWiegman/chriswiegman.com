I haven't been very good at keeping up with PTO for a while. That's not to say I haven't taken any, last year I was forced to take a lot of it when my mom passed away and then again when we moved to Chicago. That, however, wasn't stress-free. In fact, for pretty much all of it I would've rather had been at work.

What I'm not good at is taking time to unwind and recharge. For the most part I don't always think I need it but that would be the problem.

Next week I'm fixing that.

I took an entire week off. We have no plans. We're not traveling for a bit. I just need a chance to recharge and, perhaps, play tourist a bit in Chicago now that we're really getting settled in.

I can't wait.
