This morning I looked back at [what hopes I had for 2023][1].

To say [2023 didn't go as planned][2] would be a massive understatement and, I'll just leave it at that for today.

My hopes for 2024, at least at this point, are far more modest than what I hoped for last year. I simply want to get my health back on track by stopping drinking again and returning, at a minimum, to 10,000 steps per day.

The rest of this year I just want to make our new home feel like home.

That's it.

I'm not making resolutions. I'm not focusing on advancement or projects or anything else this year. I just want to get healthier and find home.

I really hope this isn't too much to ask.
