Every time I feel more positive a conversation with a friend tells me I have a long way to go. I just can't find anything positive at all about way too many things and it shows.

When I was younger I used to believe the saying "if you don't have anything nice to say then don't say anything at all." I've lost sight of that these past few years and I don't know how to fix it.
