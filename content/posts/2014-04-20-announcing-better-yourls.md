I’m happy to announce that after running on this site for almost 2 months I’ve released the [Better YOURLS WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/better-yourls/).

This little plugin makes use of the [YOURLS custom URL shortener ](http://yourls.org) to generate short links for content in your WordPress site. Where there are other plugins that do this, Better YOURLS does one more thing… It integrates with [Jetpack](http://jetpack.me) sharing to make sure your short link shows up everywhere it needs to be.

Setup is easy, just install it like normal, add your short domain and add the “Secret Token” from the YOURLS tools page. That’s it. The plugin takes care of the rest.

If you use Jetpack and YOURLS [download Better YOURLS today](https://wordpress.org/plugins/better-yourls/).
