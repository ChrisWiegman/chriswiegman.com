![10 Things About Google](/images/2011/03/10-Things-About-Google-225x179-1.jpg)

Before I get too far into this let me set the record straight. I am a [Google](https://www.google.com/ "Google") user. I use it for a LOT of stuff. It isn’t perfect however and here are 10 things Google does (or doesn’t do) that drives me nuts:

1.  Documentation. Forums are great, but the lack of real documentation for many services can make figuring out a new product difficult at best
2.  [Apple](http://www.apple.com "Apple") integration. Gmail and Google Contacts need a better way to integrate with Mac Mail and address book. Right now the setup is so clunky it’s ridiculous
3.  Too many similar results on different searches. If I didn’t click on a link during the 1st search please don’t show me it again. There is a reason I did another search and it isn’t that the first query solved my problem
4.  No Google Profiles for Apps users. Not a deal breaker, but annoying all the same.
5.  Integration with other services such as websites not all that easy (see point #1)
6.  Support, what support? Ever try to get someone on the phone when troubleshooting Adsense or Adwords? Yeah, good luck with that.
7.  Gmail Workflow – it’s great for 90% of what I do, but the threading can really throw off your workflow when you’re trying to review old emails.
8.  Android Vendors – After Android I would never go to iPhone, but I do wish that when a new version of Android is out everyone would get it and quickly
9.  Android Bookmark Sync – if you make the browsers ([Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome "Google Chrome") and Android Web Browser) shouldn’t you be able to sync bookmarks between them?
10.  Google Users – I spend so much of my time these days teaching people how to use Google products. I wish there were better tutorials for this.
