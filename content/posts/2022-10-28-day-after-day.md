As October comes to an end I find myself working hard at trying to be more positive about life, albeit with mixed results.

More and more anymore I can’t find anything positive about anything. I go from day to day, place to place, thing to thing and all of it just pisses me off. I’m so very tired of it.

I’ve committed to trying to change that a few times this past year or so but, so far, nothing seems to work. That’s on me and I know it. I also know that something has got to give as I simply cannot keep going on like this day after day.
