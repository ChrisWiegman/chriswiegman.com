For the last few years it has been very difficult for me to find curiosity in just about anything. Even things that have always fascinated me have just been, at best, boring and mostly a chore.

These past few weeks I find that changing again. I've started learning Rust and am playing with Swift. I'm exploring some travel possibilities as well as places I could volunteer at when we're a bit more settled. It feels wonderful.

I'm even making plans for what I want to do with this site again. First is migrating my book collection from Goodreads (something I've wanted to do for years but haven't had the energy for). After that, the sky is the limit.

When it comes to depression and anxiety I'm definitely not out of the woods, yet, but I'm starting to see some signs of light at the edges of the darkness and I kinda like it. Curiosity is returning and, I hope, soon shall the energy that I need to make something of that curiosity.
