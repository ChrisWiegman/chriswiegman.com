This week marks 1 year since I started blogging 3 days a week.

For the most part I consider this site successful. I set out with a goal of writing more and on that I have absolutely succeeded.

Sure, not all posts are great. Lately I seem to have lost my voice entirely and, you know what? That's just fine

For the first time I set out to do something for a full year and I succeeded. I don't feel like I've gotten all that many wins lately so, on this, I'm pretty happy. Here's to hoping I can keep it going for another year and beyond.
