When I was a fairly new developer I had it my head that the goal of a senior developer or, maybe more accurately, the benefit of being a senior developer was that "code is easy."

For a good few years I assumed, naively, that the goal was to learn a tech so well that the challenge "disappeared" or was somehow lessened due to experience. In the years since I've grown well past that belief but I still hear it all too often from many other folks gaining experience in tech.

If goal is to make senior-level so that code will be easy, you have the wrong goal.

The difference between a senior and junior dev is not about easy. Sure, a senior dev can accomplish things a junior will struggle with and do so quickly, but that isn't easy in and of itself. The challenges simply grow alongside your position and experience. Embrace that.
