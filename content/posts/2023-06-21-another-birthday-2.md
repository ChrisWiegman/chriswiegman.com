When I was a kid I was always so excited about today, my birthday. Now that my 40's are officially half over I'm not so excited about it anymore. In fact, I find myself rather dreading it and the anxiety leading up to it.

Maybe it's that I find myself generally trapped in a situation I hate. If that's true then by next Summer things will move up as I've made a pledge that this will be my last Summer in Florida. Maybe it's something else.

This has been a very rough year for me and my family and I've been dreading today just a little more than last year.

Perhaps I'm just tired in general.
