It's been a busy week at home, but that's nothing compared to what is coming over the next couple of weeks.

Looking back I've actually been home most of the week, but that doesn't mean it hasn't been busy.

Joy found a class at [Second City][1] on improv which she started on Wednesday. It's really the first time in at least 5 years she has been able to leave the house for something for _her_ and not just for WordPress and I'm really excited for her on it.

The other big thing has been are car. We noticed last week that we need new tires as ours are 6 years old and we noticed the cracks in them on Father's Day. We quickly made an appointment for yesterday and she took the car in... and blew a tire a few miles from the shop. Fortunately AAA picked her up, even if it was a 2-hour wait, and she was on the way to the tire shop anyway so they took her the rest of the way and there didn't seem to be any further damage but it was nerve-racking. I wish I could've been there to help but I have to work this week so I stayed home.

The tire shop we picked is about 50 miles from near Joy's sister's house. She was going to go there anyway today to have a garage sale. When we moved to Chicago we downsized considerably and have been storing the extra at Joy's sister's place. They're having a neighborhood garage sale today and tomorrow so the plan had been for Joy to go out there last night to prep for that. Other than the 2 hours waiting for the tow truck nothing has really changed there and she spent the night out there.

After work today I'll take the train to my father's house. It's about 50 miles from here as well but in a different direction than Joy's sister. Tomorrow Joy, my dad, myself and my brother's family will meet at for a [Rugby game][2]. The tickets were part of my birthday gifts to my father and my brother and I'm really looking forward to it myself.

We were planning on coming home after the game tomorrow but my father isn't comfortable driving at night by himself since my mother passed last year. The stadium is about 60 miles from his house so I can't really blame him. I'll drive back to his place with him and Joy will continue home. That's a must because of what's going on Sunday.

Sunday is the [Chicago Pride parade][3] and it almost completely circles our building. This means that driving home on Sunday is out of the question. I'll take the train home in the morning as I'm looking forward to the parade myself.

Then it's on to my last week at WP Engine. I'm super excited about my new role but leaving an old one is never easy and I fear my last days next week will be stressful for a lot of reasons.

Beyond that... I have no idea what is going to happen, how are life will look, etc. I feel like the changes coming up in the next few weeks are at least as big as the change we experienced moving to Chicago last December.

I'm looking forward to the ride but... it's going to be a wild one.
