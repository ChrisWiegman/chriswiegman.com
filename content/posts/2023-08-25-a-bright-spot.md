The last few years haven't been the best for me. Of course, if you're reading this you've probably guessed that (and I've talked about it way too much).

There really haven't been many bright spots. The one exception has been Ted Lasso. I think it's the only series I've watched all through and, as I'm writing this, I'm working through it again for the 5th or 6th time.

In a world that just seems so very dark, to me Ted Lasso has been a rare source of hope. The only downside of the whole series for me was watching it end in May.

I even hold out hope that we'll see some of the characters again, in one form or another, and that they can bring back some of the magic for the show's three seasons.

Here's to hope you have found your bright spot too.
