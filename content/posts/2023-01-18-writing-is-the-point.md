As I sit here to write this I find myself with 100 post ideas and no energy to execute on any of them.

It's time to acknowledge that this is OK.

I didn't start writing here with the idea that this blog would somehow pay the bills or win me awards. Instead, I started writing here to share what is on my mind and to get better at writing in general. At both pursuits I would like to think I've been successful and that makes it worth it.

So it's OK if I don't have the energy to do more right now. Hopefully, one day, I will have that energy again. In the meantime I'll just keep writing as, sometimes, that really is the point.
