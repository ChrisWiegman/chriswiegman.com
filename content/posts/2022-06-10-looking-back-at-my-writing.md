As I approach a year of regular blogging I find myself looking back on everything I've written. How much of it was worth it? How much of it was garbage? How many mistakes did I make, words did I write, etc?

On one hand I want to see what, if any, improvements I've made over the past years. On the other I don't really care how well I did. The point has always been to get better at, and simply practice more writing. On that I'm going to call this past year successful and look forward to the years to come.
