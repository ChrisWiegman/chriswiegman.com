The temperatures are still above normal (for Chicago) this week but it's dropped back to what feels extra-cold for me. I missed a walk this morning as a result (well, it was raining hard this morning too) and haven't gotten outside today.

Tomorrow is looking a lot better and I think we'll get our morning walk in. We'll see past that. I need to rethink my fitness routine some and maybe, just maybe, this will be the catalyst to do it.
