Well, I'm still having to write away from home this week so I'm afraid my posts will still be a bit on the short side.

In good news we're back at our house and we have power. What we still don't have, however, is internet so I am eternally grateful to my friend David Johnson for being so kind as to let us use his place to work. If it wasn't for him I would've had to go to Chicago instead of coming home as I just cannot miss work this week.
