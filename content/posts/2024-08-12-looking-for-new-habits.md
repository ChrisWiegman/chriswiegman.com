Finding time to write has not been easy. Up until this month I had at least been able to get _something_ out on a regular schedule but even that has fallen to the side with my new job.

Other things that have fallen with my new schedule: my diet, exercise, sleep, reading, Duolingo and probably a few other things. In fact, the only habit that has increased over the last month is my beer intake.

Right now I'm not sure how I'm going to fix this but, fix it I must. My new schedule often leaves me with as much as 6 fewer hours per day of time to do anything compared to before. Writing, exercise and everything else takes time and time is something I no longer have available to me.

It's time to get more creative.
