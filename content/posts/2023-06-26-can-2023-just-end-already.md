2023 struck again this past weekend, this time it was our 13 year old dog, Kana who had a violent seizure on Saturday afternoon. As I write this on Sunday afternoon he is still at the animal ER and, while he hasn't had further seizures they're not sure what caused what he did have and he is not recovering like they had hoped. He's still not walking and is very lethargic, both signs the vet says aren't good.

I don't know how much more of this year I can take at this point. We lost our little kitty, Lindy, in February. We lost my mom and my 2nd cousin's son (who was only 25) during the same week in April, a week that my mom's cousin, the grandfather of the one who died, also nearly died himself of a massive heart attack. Now this.

All of this is on top of the fact that my anxiety and depression are getting worse by the day as I feel trapped here in Florida, a situation I truly hate.

I really hope the rest of the year gets better. I really can't take much more of this. I am truly at the end of my rope.
