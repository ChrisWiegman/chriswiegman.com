Today I do something I haven't done in 11 years: I go into an actual office to work.

I never thought I would do this but moving to Chicago has changed my mind a bit. One of our issues in Florida was that we didn't know many people and, as we were both 100% remote, we had few options to really get out and fix that. I don't want to make that mistake here too.

So, into an office I go. With 21 more years until I hit retirement age I'm hoping it will be a chance to network in person and, as I said above, to meet people locally.

It doesn't have to be forever either. I suspect there will be options to be more remote at the new company in the future and, if not, there are plenty of other places where I could go for a remote gig. For now, though, I'm kinda looking forward to getting out a bit. It's been so very, very long.
