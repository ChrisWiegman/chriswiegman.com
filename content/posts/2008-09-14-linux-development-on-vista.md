I’ve been using <a href="http://www.linux.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Linux</a> off-and-on for about the last 10 years. At times it has even been my only operating system on whatever computer I was using. The thing was I wouldn’t dual-boot and none of the virtual machines I tried could really keep up with what I was doing.

As for the dual boot, it just never seemed worth it to waste so much of my hard-drive space so I could waste more time switching between operating systems whenever I needed something on the other one. As for the virtual machines, although they would load a guest OS, they tended to make one system or the other almost unusable in that switching between the two was often less than a pleasant experience. Heck, I don’t know how many times I’ve killed either the guest or the host when the VM did something it shouldn’t.

Finally, as of last week, I think I’ve found a VM I really like. Actually, it’s a VM I’ve used for some time, but until it’s latest update I found it less than an enjoyable experience. This new [updated] VM is <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VirtualBox by Sun</a>. In the 2.0 release last week it is more stable, and seems to be much more efficient in how it handles the resources on the host system. Finally I can run <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ubuntu</a> for various tasks on my primary machine without having to worry about how long I have until the next crash!
