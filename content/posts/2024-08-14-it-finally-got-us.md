After 4.5 years COVID has officially hit our household.

While there is a good chance what I had in June 2021 was COVID, there were no tests available near me at the time and the doctor told me not to bother testing unless it got so bad that I would need to go to the hospital so... I don't know for sure.

This week we are officially testing positive though after Joy spent some extra time with her family last week. They reported positive tests to her on Monday, she tested positive Monday evening and I had a fever by Tuesday morning.

Here's to hoping it's a mild case without lasting effects.
