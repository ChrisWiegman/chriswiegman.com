When I was a kid I used to look forward to my birthday. We usually spent it on the beach in Panama City Beach and the family would go out to lunch or dinner together while I generally just enjoyed the day.

These days I definitely don't look forward to it like I used to.

Tomorrow is my birthday. It's another day to remind me that I'm getting older and another day to remind me that the future isn't looking bright.

My consolation: I've taken the day off this year to round out a 4-day weekend. That's about all I have to look forward to though. Frankly, that's about all I can ask of anything these days.

Maybe one day I'll look forward to my birthday again. This is not that year.
