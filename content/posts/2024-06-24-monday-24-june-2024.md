It was another weekend where, between not feeling well through my birthday and Saturday and having family commitments yesterday, I was not able to write like I had hoped.

Part of me is annoyed that this is such a habit. Another part of me realizes that I legitimately just have no time to sit down and do anything at all that takes more than a couple of minutes.

One day, perhaps, this will change.
