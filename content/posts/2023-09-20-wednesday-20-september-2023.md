It's Tuesday evening as I write this and we just got home from getting our latest COVID booster. With a trip to Chicago coming up in just over two weeks for the the first part of our move, and with so very many people we know getting COVID again I'm grateful the updated booster is finally available this week.

I'm still excited and terrified about the move but I guess that's natural. At least, this time, we know it won't be our "forever" home and we'll look forward to moving again, hopefully to Portugal, in a few years.

I'm also excited about something else this week that I'm not normally excited about, getting a new iPhone and Apple Watch.

My current phone works but, at 2 years and 8 months old, is the oldest cell phone I've ever had. That's not because I choose to upgrade but because the previous record, 2 years and 1 month, I hit twice at which point the phones died. On my iPhone 7 it was the modem. On my Pixel 3XL it was the touch screen and resulted in me buying my current iPhone.

The watch is a little different. When I first had an Apple Watch in 2017 I hated it. After 7 months I sold it to a friend and went back to Fitbit. I bought my second Apple Watch the day I bought my current iPhone and it lasted until last Saturday when a new charger we bought fried its battery. I really liked the Apple Watch the second time around. It worked well with me for fitness and how I use my tech in general and I actually do miss having it around.

This Friday both are getting replaced. The watch with a new series 9 because I have to and the phone with a 15 Pro Max because I just don't trust my existing phone will last much longer and I need to have it ready and working more than ever for the next few months. With a little bit of luck I hope both of these devices will last a full 3 or 4 years this time!
