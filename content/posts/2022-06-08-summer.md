The long days of summer are here. From now until, at least, October we'll see lows of 24C/75F every night and highs around 33C/91F every day.

Our morning walks are miserable and I just don't want to go outside at all. In a world being wrecked by COVID I feel even more like a prisoner in my house during the long summer and it really takes its toll.

When we lived in Carbondale, IL the summers were marked by motorcycle rides and sunset concerts. Here they're marked by my avoiding going outside at all unless it is too or from the car.

Add to this all that it's hurricane season and my anxiety spikes through the roof until November and I just want to shut down every summer.

Oh how I can't wait to move back to a place where I can enjoy the area again.
