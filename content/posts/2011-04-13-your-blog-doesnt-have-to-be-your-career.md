I’ll say it again. You’re blog doesn’t have to be your career.

Now, what does that mean?

It means don’t overshoot your goals with your blog and don’t worry if your site isn’t as big as someone else’s. It means that your subject might not ever have the ability to make you a million dollars or bring in a million visitors a day, and, most importantly, it means that if blogging is no longer fun because you are worried about too many aspects of it than you are no better off than anyone else doing a job they don’t like.

So sit back, relax, and enjoy what you have without worrying about what you don’t. Success is measured with more than visitor counts and ad dollars.
