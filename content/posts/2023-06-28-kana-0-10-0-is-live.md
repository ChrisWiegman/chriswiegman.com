This past weekend I released new versions of [Kana][1] up to 0.10.0.

These latest updates make it more flexible for different types of projects with features such as a flush command to clear cache and configurable MariaDB versions. It also preps for some upcoming features by changing the "phpmyadmin" flag on the open command to a "database" flag which will make more sense in future versions if you want to use a tool like TablePlus or something else instead of phpmyadmin.

I'm really pleased where the project is going for my own work and I'm looking at a few further features to make it easier for the many plugins and themes I work on, still, myself. It's already the most sensible tool I've found for such work and I think it's only going to get better going forward.

In the coming months I hope to start talking about it a bit more and shift to building a proper site for it. This is where it will go from my personal hobby to something I really do think can help a lot more WordPress developers.

I hope you'll come along for the ride.
