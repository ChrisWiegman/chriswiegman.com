Our first weekend post-Florida-home ownership was a success, mostly.

We went out Friday night to celebrate being done with Florida and we celebrated a little too hard. That lead to a very quiet Saturday but that in itself was worth it. It was the first day in a very long time where I wasn't worried about the house sale or something else with Florida.

We spent today shopping for a sofa for our living room (the one thing we didn't really have to move with us) and wound up stopping at a cheap but wonderful Mongolian BBQ place. It was the most relaxing Sunday out in a very long time.

No, not everything is perfect right now. I'm still not sure what's going on with work and my anxiety is still giving me hell but, at the same time, I feel like I can have a life again. We finally escaped the home that had become my prison and it feels wonderful.

Here's to many more wonderful weekends.
