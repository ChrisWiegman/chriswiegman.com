Another great opportunity has presented itself to me this weekend. I am speaking not once but twice at WordCamp Providence in Providence, RI. In addition to my talk on “Securing WordPress the Right Way” I had the honor of presenting a 4-hour workshop on securing WordPress with Joseph Herbrandson of [Sucuri.net](http://sucuri.net) which which went spectacularly yesterday and will hopefully start a series of such events as we move forward.
