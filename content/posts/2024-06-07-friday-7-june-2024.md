This week has been something. It seems I can't find time to think, much less write. From the moment my alarm goes off in the morning to the moment I go to bed at night we're on the move.

On the one hand, I really do enjoy "having a life" again. In Florida we were in a rut where we didn't do or go anywhere. On the other hand I look forward to some focus time in the coming weeks where I can write, work on various projects and more.
