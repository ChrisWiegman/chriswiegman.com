This is just a quick post to serve as a reminder that you can participate in the WordPress community and still tune out the toxicity of some of its members. Do your own thing, enjoy yourself and don’t let the drama get to you.

This post is sponsored by my Twitter block list and other tools I’ve used to do just this over the past year resulting in me actually loving my time in WordPress again.
