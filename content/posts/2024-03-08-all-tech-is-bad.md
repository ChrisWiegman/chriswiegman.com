I've ranted, raved and fanboy-ed about tech for most of the last 30 years.

You must use this!

No one should use that!

This is great! That is the worst!

It's like a broken record and, if you're online around tech people at all, it's completely inescapable.

Here's the truth: **_all tech is bad and no tech is perfect._**

That's it. Stop worrying about what works or doesn't work for some talking head online and use what works for you. It's a tool, not your identity.
