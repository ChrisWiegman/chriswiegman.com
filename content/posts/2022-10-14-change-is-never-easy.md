Selling a house is never easy.

I've done it twice, so far, in my life and I don't look forward to the third but, it's time.

Where are we going? I don't know yet in the short term, as long as it isn't Florida I'm sure I'll be happy. In the long term we are looking heavily at Portugal.

Change is never easy, and this is no exception. That said, it's time and I'm excited about that part.
