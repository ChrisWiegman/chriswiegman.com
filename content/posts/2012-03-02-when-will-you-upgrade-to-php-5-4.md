[PHP 5.4 was officially released yesterday](http://www.php.net/archive/2012.php#id2012-03-01-1 "PHP 5.4.0 released!") and from what I’ve been reading it looks as if the migration won’t be anywhere near as painful as the migration to PHP 5.3 was and it will offer some serious performance benefits.

[**So when will you be upgrading?**](http://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/peebf/php_54_is_really_fast_and_with_less_memory_leaks/ "Reddit conversation on PHP 5.4 performance")
