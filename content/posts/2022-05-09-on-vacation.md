I'm on vacation until 17 May.

We're not going anywhere, just staying home. Already, though, I feel more rested and relaxed.

As an example of how far I've come, today I started rebuilding my office (post to follow when it's done) and I didn't freak out that it wasn't done in a day. That's a level of relaxation that is very unusual for me.

Here's to hoping you have a great, relaxing week as well.
