It doesn't matter what I turn on the TV or the radio. It doesn't matter what book I open or social media I pull up. Whether it's a news program, a novel or even a baseball game everything is full of the negative and I'm hitting the point where I just don't want to deal with any of it anymore.

The last really "happy" media (or at least the last media that really made me happy) was Ted Lasso. I've read some good books in the last few months but even those tend to have some very triggering moments lately and there just isn't any escape.

My goal, over the coming weeks, is going to be to fix that, at least as much as I can. My home situation is already enough of a stressor for me and I need an escape, any escape. It just isn't healthy to live like this.
