I've been experimenting with browsers again lately. On Mac I've used Safari for years but work would really like us to use Chrome on our work machines so I gave it a shot... and was back on Safari within a week (at least for now as they're supposed to make Chrome, and Chrome only, a hard requirement before long).

For my own computers I use Firefox on Linux but lately I've found it seems less stable so I've tried installing Vivaldi and a few others and, as with my work machine... I was quickly back to Firefox.

The catch is, I still only use Firefox on my Linux machine because I don't really have an alternative. I really do like Safari's "compact" tab view and how it handles both my favorites and reading list. I even like it's newer profiles feature, though I have little use for it currently because I keep my work strictly separate from my personal computing.

I would like this to be the point where I come in and say what would make me switch but, honestly, I just don't much care anymore. I just want to use what works best for me and, today, that's Safari. Sometimes good enough really is just good enough.
