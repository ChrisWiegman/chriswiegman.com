This weekend marks 2 years since our last pre-COVID trip. We went to Disney World for 2 days to meetup with our friend Michele Butcher-Jones and her family for her daughter's high school band trip.

There are a lot of things that have changed for us in the two years since that trip. Some for the worse (we're no longer comfortable with living in Florida, for example) but many for the better.

I'm 10lbs lighter than I was on that last trip

I haven't had any alcoholic drink since Halloween 2020 and I haven't had a soda since Halloween 2021.

I've read almost 200 books.

I finally started blogging regularly.

I switched work roles and became an engineering manager.

I've learned to be happy with what we have at home without having to constantly "escape" via travel.

Personally the last two years really haven't been bad for us. They've taught us so much about ourselves as we spent them learning how to live a simpler life. It is a life I hope we can continue long after the COVID virus itself is just a memory.
