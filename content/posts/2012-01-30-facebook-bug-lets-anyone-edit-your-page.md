If you’re the admin of a Facebook page you’ll want to turn off the map on the page info. There is a current bug that will allow anyone to change the info of any page on which a map is displayed (see the above image. I am not an admin of that page).

## Here’s how to fix it.

1.  First, you must be an admin of the page to fix it.
2.  Log into your Facebook account and switch to the page you need to edit (click the arrow in the upper right corner and use Facebook as the page in question).
3.  Click “Edit Page” in the top right corner.
4.  Select “Basic Information” from the sidebar on the left.
5.  Un-check “Show this map on the page.”

6.  Click “Save Changes” at the bottom.

Now your page is safe from random editing.
