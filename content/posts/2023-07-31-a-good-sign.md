I had grandiose plans for a long post tonight but, alas, they were foiled. It was for a good reason though.

A neighbor is interested in buying the house we own if we move so we showed her around. We're not ready to sell, yet, but at least we know we should have some options when we are ready.

Oh how I can't wait to get out of Florida. Maybe this is a good sign that we'll be out of here sooner rather than later.
