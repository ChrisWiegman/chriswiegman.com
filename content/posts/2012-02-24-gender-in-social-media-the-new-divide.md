  I’m going to try something new today I’m going to call Discussion Fridays. Rather than a lengthy tutorial or other similar post I’m going to instead post questions for discussion in the comments section. The idea being to incorporate more interaction and the ideas of more folks than just myself.
</p>

So here goes the Bit51 Discussion Friday topic 1:

The rise in popularity of sites like <a title="Pinterest" href="http://pinterest.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pinterest</a> has some interesting implications on the social media world. For the first time a social network has gone mainstream with <a title="NPR: So Pinterest Is A Woman's World. Does That Matter?" href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2012/02/22/147222619/so-pinterest-is-a-womans-world-does-that-matter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">overwhelming support primarily from women</a>. How do you think this will affect the social media landscape as a whole? Is this the beginning of a new&nbsp;paradigm&nbsp;or just a fluke?
