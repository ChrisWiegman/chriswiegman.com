Last week I worked from home after Covid finally hit us.

This week it’s back to the office.

My office is just a few blocks from the DNC and I suspect this week is going to be interesting, to put it mildly. Right now my only hope is that it doesn’t slow us down too much.

At least we have a Gaelic Storm concert to look forward to on Thursday night. That is shaping up to be the highlight of my week!
