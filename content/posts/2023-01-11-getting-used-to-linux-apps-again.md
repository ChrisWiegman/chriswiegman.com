After a month [back on Linux][1] I find myself struggling a bit more this time with apps. When I can get things working they're generally good but still, perhaps because I'm not using it full time today, I'm finding the transition period much harder than last time.

It isn't just one thing either. It's Firefox, Thunderbird, Visual Studio Code and just about everything else. Not the apps themselves, either, but little things in each that drive me crazy.

It all makes it easy to understand why telling people "just use something else" is such a ridiculous response to any issue in tech. We're all creatures of habit and change is hard. When that change is to the fundamental tools you need it can just simply be too hard for many people. That's something all of us who work in tech need to remember.
