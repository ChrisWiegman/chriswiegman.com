Today I’m closing out my 2014 WordCamp season with the opportunity to share basic security principles and techniques with the folks at WordCamp DFW in Fort Worth, TX. This is another opportunity I couldn’t be more thankful for and a perfect way to end what has been an absolutely incredible year for WordPress security.
