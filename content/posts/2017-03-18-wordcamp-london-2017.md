Today I have the honor of returning to WordCamp London, which I haven’t attended since 2013, as a speaker. I’ll be giving a talk this afternoon on practical encryption that covers the basics of what encryption is, what it does and how it can be used in some of our every day communications.&nbsp;If this is a topic that interests you check out the slides below. Should the talk be recorded I’ll add the video here when it is available.

I also went to send a special thank you to Eric Mann and Paul Gilzow who both reviewed my slides with some very helpful feedback this week.
