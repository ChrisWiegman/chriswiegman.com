**1.) Blogging forces you to research and learn**

Day in and day out we go through our lives at work and home without much reason to change. Although what we are doing now might work, we often don’t have much incentive to learn anything new. Blogging helps by forcing you to learn something new as you investigate material for your writing. For example, us techie bloggers can find all sorts of new tricks and tools in the quest to research the topic of our latest post. More often than not these can be some pretty cool items we would never have heard about otherwise.

**2.) Blogging educates others**

Blogging is about educating others. It is about taking something you have learned and passing that information out to others in your field, interest group etc. There is no better way in today’s society to get you ideas published than by doing so yourself on the internet.

**3.) Blogging makes you a better writer**

Most of us were not trained as writers or journalists and lets face it, when we try we can often use some help. Like so many other skills in life writing is one in which practice makes perfect. and in an economy where the ability to efficiently communicate our ideas and experience through writing is so crucial a little practice can go a long way.

**4.) Blogging increases your visibility**

You might be the best in your field, but if no one knows about you what good does it do? Whether your an experienced professional or new rookie, writing in your field gets your name out there.

**5.) Blogging can be fun**

Not much to say about this one except it is a cool experience to see one of your posts make the front page of a service like Digg.
