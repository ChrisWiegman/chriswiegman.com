I've been blogging for around 25 years with this site having posts going back about 14 years. Over that time technology has, obviously, changed a lot. When I started blogging the only good way to get your own voice out there was to start your own site and write for it.

Social media has changed the equation and today it is easier to "make it" using someone else's platform but, at least in my opinion, a blog is still vital to both who I am, who I've been and who I want to become. While 280 character posts might be conversation, there is no medium that can match the freedom I have on this site to write about the topics I care about the most.

So why do I keep blogging? At this point I don't even know if the word "keep" applies as I'm writing more posts than ever. Not only that, but I'm reading more blogs by other people I trust than I ever have. I've found personal blogs to not only be a great source of information on a variety of topics but also they're the one honest platform left on the internet.

When we blog we can let show who we really are without filters or algorithms. We can improve our writing, express ourselves and, hopefully, help someone else all without the constant attention seekers of "likes" or other gimmicks.

I keep blogging because I enjoy writing. I also enjoy the constructive conversations that come from these posts and the people I get to engage with over time. Most of all, though, I keep blogging because to me blogging is a freedom that I can't find anywhere else.

Time change and so does our outlets for creativity. Throughout it all this site has been my one constant. I hope that never changes.
