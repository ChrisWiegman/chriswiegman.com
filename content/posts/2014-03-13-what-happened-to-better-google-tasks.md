As some of you have pointed out to me Better Google Tasks, the Google Tasks extension that had [recently been mentioned by Matt Cutts](http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/todo-list-tips/), is no longer in the Google Play Market.

The short answer as to why: I really don’t know what happened to it on the market.

The longer answer: It is the users that have pointed out its absence. A look through my email and other sources doesn’t reveal any communications about why it was removed.

I do plan on getting it back up at some point but for the moment I have to admit it isn’t high on the priorities list.
