If 2022 has been notable for anything for me it has been the ridiculous level of anxiety I've been facing so far. While that anxiety manifests in different ways it is always at the forefront of everything I do.

Over the years I've tried various methods to address my anxiety issues, all without any real help. Today it's time to try something new and contact a professional.

It's taken me a long time to get to this point. Asking for this type of help is something I was simply raised not to do. As my anxiety effects myself and those around me though, it's time to fix that.

Wish me luck!
