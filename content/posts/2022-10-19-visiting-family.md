We're home again, and I don't know when we'll be traveling again. It was, however, wonderful to see my parents this past weekend and I'm incredibly grateful for the opportunity.

There are some times I definitely miss the ability to safely travel. Thankfully we were able to visit them at their condo where we stayed except for a few meals outside. Perhaps one day it will be safe to eat inside a restaurant again but it is quite clear that the US is not yet at that point.

I don't know if that will be the last trip to their condo, but I kinda hope it isn't. I also hope we're out of Sarasota by the next time.
