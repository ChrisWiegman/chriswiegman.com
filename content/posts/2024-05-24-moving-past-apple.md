I started this post, earlier today, as a roadmap for moving out of the Apple ecosystem again, something I've tried to do with various levels of success for the last 7 years.

The catch is, I started by writing it on my Ubuntu laptop until a system update meant I could no longer connect my keyboard to it.

This seems to be my pattern with tech. I have a few absolute musts with any tech stack I use and the first of those is reliability. If I can't trust that I won't use the system.

Granted, Apple hasn't been much better for me this past year, particularly with things in my iCloud account constantly getting corrupted but, in the end, I seem to always be able to make something work.

With Linux, I spent 2 hours this afternoon trying to get the keyboard to work again. It does work fine with every other machine but something that changed in an apt update has definitely broken it with that machine. I just don't have the energy to keep putting into it this evening.

Maybe next week I'll revisit a post on moving past Apple, maybe not. At least it all seems to work.
