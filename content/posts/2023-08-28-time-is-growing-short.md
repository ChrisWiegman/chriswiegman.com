Tonight's grandiose plans for writing were spoiled by another massive seizure for my dog. They're coming more frequently now after he had his first just over two months ago.

We thought we were going to lose him this past week after a new seizure med left him in a state where he could no longer sit up. Thankfully he's a lot better after discontinuing the medication on Wednesday but the seizures are getting more regular.

I know his time is getting short and it is so very hard to watch.

This year really does need to end already. I really can't take any more of this.
