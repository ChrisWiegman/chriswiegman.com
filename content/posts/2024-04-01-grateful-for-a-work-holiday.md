Today is a Wellness Day at work. We get one each quarter as something of a holiday and, after these past 2 weeks, I need this one more than ever.

I wouldn't call my current state burnout, just stress from a lot of acute events all put together in a very short amount of time.

Here's to hoping most of that stress is past in the coming weeks.
