Yesterday I started retaking a JavaScript course I bought a few years ago. While JS isn't my favorite tech to work it, taking such a course has been more fun than I've had in tech in a while.

Don't get me wrong, I love working with [Kana][1], but learning something new-ish is also fun for me. Now that I no longer write code for my day job I don't have the opportunity to learn new things like I used to so I appreciate it.

I wish I had the energy to do things like this more often.
