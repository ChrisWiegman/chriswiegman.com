Have your Apple friends ever sent you a document made in Pages or Keynote? Fear not, it is actually easier to view the contents of&nbsp;either of these documents than it is to open something made by nearly any other office app.

Note that either of these procedures will work on any modern operating system whether it runs&nbsp;Windows, OS X, Linux, or something else.&nbsp;

### For Pages

All pages files end with the _.pages_&nbsp;extension. Change the _.pages_&nbsp;to _.zip_&nbsp;and open the file with any zip utility. Inside you will find a _QuickLook_&nbsp;folder in which the document can be found in _.pdf_ format capable of being read by any pdf reader.

### For Keynote

Just like in Pages, Keynote files are really zip archives. Change the _.key_&nbsp;extension to _.zip_&nbsp;and open it with your zip utility. Inside go to the _thumbs_&nbsp;folder. You will find .jpg images of the contents of the presentation near the end of the folder (if sorted alphabetically). The only downside is with Keynote the thumbnail images are just that, thumbnails, you’ll be able to get the gist of the presentation but any formatting or other detail will be lost.
