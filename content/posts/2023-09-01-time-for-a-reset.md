It's no secret that 2023 has been a rough year for me. While I tend to think I'm not handling it too badly there has been a few slips that I really want to fix and today is the day to start that.

For what it's worth, I do best at habits when I start them with a new month. This goes for exercise, eating habits and so many others.

On November 1, 2020 I quit drinking beer and, mostly, soda. I was never a regular beer drinker in that it wasn't a daily thing but I've always been the type of drinker who would go out for 1 and leave at 5. Soda is a different story. I was, and still am, physically addicted to it.

While the soda fast didn't last too long I do drink less of it today. As for beer, I didn't have another one again until I was in Porto this past March. At the time I didn't feel too bad about that (it was vacation after all) and when we got home I quit again... for a few weeks.

In early April my mom passed away, unexpectedly, and my resolve around beer, soda and a lot of other things fell off a cliff. To get out of the house, and my own thoughts, we started going back to a local bar once a week and, just like I used to, one beer always turns into 5.

Today that ends again. It's been almost 5 months now. My exercise is down, my sleep is worse and I really don't much care for the drinking to start with. It is a social thing for me, an excuse to leave the house and a bad one at that.

I miss how I feel when I quit for 2.5 years so it's time to go back to that and start getting back to daily exercise (though we missed this part today because, well, I had a few beers last night). Next month I'll try cutting out soda again and then... the sky is the limit.
