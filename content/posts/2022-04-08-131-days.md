Today marks 131 days in a row of me hitting 10,000 steps per day, a record by quite a bit.

Prior to getting my Apple Watch in January, 2021 my record was about 10 days. My goal with the new watch was to use it to change how I viewed fitness and it worked.

Today I'm healthier and I feel better than I had in years before starting. My average walking mile is 16.5-17.5 minutes per mile, down from ~19 last January and I feel like I've finally found something I can enjoy outside.

There are a lot of ways to get more fit. This one has worked for me after years of trial and error. Here's to hoping you can find what works for you.
