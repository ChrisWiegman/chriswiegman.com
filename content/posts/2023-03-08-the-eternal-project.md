My favorite project is often a project that I can never finish.

I don't mean that it is unusable or impossible, but my favorite projects are the ones where there is always something more to adapt or evolve. It's a project where I can sit down today or two years from now and still have something to work on, something to improve that users will find useful.

Today [Kana][1], my WordPress development CLI, is just that project. As it nears a full year old there is still plenty I want to do with and, whenever I get a chance to sit down with it (which, I confess, is not as often as I would like) I know exactly what I want to work on to make it just a little bit better.

There are other projects I avoid because there would be a very definite "done" point. For example, scripts I would use once or things I would need to set up and then forget. A perfect example of this is moving my book collection from Goodreads to my own WordPress site. I start working on it and sit down with code and ideas but I never get far as I can't see far enough down the road. Instead I see the end of the road, at least in terms of the work I would need to do, and I just freeze up and walk away.

It's a rather strange "problem" to have, I get that. Perhaps, like so many other things, if I begin to acknowledge that I can begin to do something about it as well.
