On Monday I finished my 60th book so far in 2022.

I set a goal for myself to read 50 for the year. I've been using the goals, which I set in [GoodReads][1] to set a goal every year going back to 2010. My previous record was 94 books read in 2020 and I'm well on track to beat that this year and I'm pretty proud of that accomplishment.

Books are, at least to me, my favorite way to slow down and enjoy the moment. Slowing down is something that is too hard for so many folks these days so I'll take this accomplishment as a sign that I'm going it right.
