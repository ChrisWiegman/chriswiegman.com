I'll be on hiatus for the next two weeks as we do the first half of our move to Chicago. We're leaving at the end of the week and will be moving our offices and a few others things up for now. Then we'll come back to Sarasota for a bit until the house sells here.

It isn't ideal to split the move like this but we've done it before. This time it's the speed of the move (the place we bought wasn't even on the market until 3 weeks ago and we close tomorrow) combined with our aging pup.

[Kana][1], our 13 and a 1/2 year old friend is not doing well. After a series of seizures starting last June he can no longer stand on his own. While he's not in pain, his mobility is heavily limited and we just don't think it's fair to him for us to move him up until we absolutely have to. Honestly, I'm not sure he's going to make it that long as he's declining pretty rapidly at this point so keeping him here, in a place we know, seems like the right thing to do.

So for the next couple of months I'll be immersing myself in my work from our dining room table and hoping we're all up in Chicago, permanently, by Christmas. That would be a great holiday present.
