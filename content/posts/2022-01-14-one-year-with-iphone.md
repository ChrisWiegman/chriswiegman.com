This weekend, the 16th to be exact, will mark exactly one year since I came back to iPhone.

When I moved to Google Pixel in 2017 I really didn't think I would be coming back to iPhone at all. The Pixel worked well, the service (Google Fi at the time) was great and, generally, I was pretty happy with the tech but, things change.

Am I happy with the phone after a year? Yeah, why not? It does what I need it to do and it is still functioning a year later. I don't know what else I could ask from such a device anymore.

That said, there are still parts of Android I really do miss. The interface was easier to use, apps such as alternative browsers were available at their full power and, if I stuck with the Google ecosystem, the integration was 95% as good as Apple's for about 1/3 of the price. That wasn't a bad place to be.

That said, the Apple device integration is better overall, even if I had to pay more for it, and iOS has been more reliable than Android was. Add that into I've had better luck getting Apple devices to last compared to the alternatives and I really have nothing to complain about.

In a perfect world I would go back to Linux and use private, open software to power my life. This isn't a perfect world. What this is is the best we have available to us today and, anymore, that's good enough. I just don't have the energy right now to try to replace all that again.
