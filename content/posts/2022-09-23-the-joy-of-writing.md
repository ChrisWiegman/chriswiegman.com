Three times a week I sit down to write a post.

Some days the content comes easily and I produce something I'm proud show to you.

Other days, especially during the summer where seasonal depression and anxiety get the best of me, the posts look more like tweets than any thing else as there is just nothing left in me to say.

Regardless of good or bad, though, I still publish something and I think it has been one of the best moves I've made.

If I can ever find it in me I would still love to write more content for other sites or even a book. These past few years even the idea of doing so has seemed like an insurmountable obstacle. Two years ago, however, I would've said the same thing about actually publishing three posts a day too.

I'm getting there, day by day, post by post. That is something I am immensely proud of this year.

If you're thinking of starting your own blog or just keeping it going, do it. The only person you have to write for is you and, once you realize that, writing in general becomes so much more interesting.
