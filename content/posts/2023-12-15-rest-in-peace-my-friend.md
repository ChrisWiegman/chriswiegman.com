The disaster that has been 2023 has continued unabated for us. First it was [losing our cat Lindy][1] in February. Then my mom passed in April. I was hoping we were done at that point, but that was not the case.

On October 6th we lost our dog, [Kana][2].

He was my wife's best friend and part of our family for over 13 years. As I write this I still haven't been able to process the fact that he's gone.

I've been around a lot of dogs in my life and I can truthfully say I've never met one as gentle as Kana. He was always there and always a calming presence.

Last year he lent his name to my personal project, Kana and I'm glad he did. At least his name will continue on.

I will miss you, my friend.
