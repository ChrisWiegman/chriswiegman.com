On Monday of this week I hit a record I honestly never thought I could possibly achieve. I finished one full year of walking 10,000 or more steps a day without missing a single day.

While I’ve been walking an tracking my steps for over a decade, until I bought an Apple Watch in January of last year I never averaged more than 5,000 steps a day over a single year. I would try to increase my step goal but it never stuck. Even last year, where we were also home due to the pandemic, I averaged more than 10,000 steps a day but still missed it a number of days for various reasons.

This year, even with a few long drives and travel (including a 12 hour 1-day drive each way in September) I still managed to walk every day and I couldn’t be more proud of this.

There are still a lot of healthy habits I could do better on but, for once, my activity and sleep levels aren’t on that list and I’m incredibly proud of that. Here’s to upping my game even further over the coming year!
