If there is anything I tend to struggle with it is relaxing.

I returned home late Friday night from a work trip to Ireland with a plan of taking Saturday off. I mostly failed.

If I'm not working on actual work I'm working on my personal code projects. They're fun, they're my hobby, but they're also so close to my work as to be practically indistinguishable.

I want to read, but I struggle to unless I'm in bed.

I want to watch TV but it's been since before COVID that doing so was possible for me on almost any level (with the exception of Ted Lasso).

If I'm not working, I'm failing at something and it is getting so very, very old.
