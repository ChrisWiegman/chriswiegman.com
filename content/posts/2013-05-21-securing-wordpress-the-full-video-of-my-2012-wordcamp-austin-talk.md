Some things are better late than never, right? I like to think so and as such here is the full video of my talk last year at WordCamp Austin. The session was titled “Securing WordPress is Easier Than Making Coffee” and included a number of tips and tricks designed to help you keep your WordPress site from falling victim to the attacks that seem to plague all too many users.<figure class="wp-block-embed-wordpress-tv wp-block-embed is-type-video wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio">
