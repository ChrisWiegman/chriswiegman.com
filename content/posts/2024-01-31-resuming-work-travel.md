This week I booked my first work trip in 4 years. That's quite a departure from 2019 where I was on the road just over 180 days for the year and, honestly, I don't much care to travel for work anymore but it must be done.

Of course I'll keep masked and all while I'm gone. I've already learned that we can travel safely if we're careful about it.

I also know this trip could be extremely valuable for my team and our work and I am excited about that.

I'm just no longer excited about travel for work. It feels weird but, here we are.
