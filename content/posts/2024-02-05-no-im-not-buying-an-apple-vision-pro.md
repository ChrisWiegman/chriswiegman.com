My feed this weekend is full of people talking about Apple’s latest “must have” gadget, the Vision Pro. While I’m not on the hate wagon against it I am not buying one either.

Apple’s device releases are just weird to me. Going back to the iPhone (the first time I noticed the phenomenon) the hype is so far beyond the promise that I find it all a little gross. So much so that, when the iPad was released, I do remember certain Apple fanboys mocking me for saying I didn’t want one.

All these years later I do have an iPad and am typing this post from it. The iPad, like the iPhone, has evolved to be a great tool for those who have a need. It took a long time past launch for them to get to this point and maybe the Vision Pro will get there too but today it is not that kind of tool.

Today I have two issues with the Vision Pro. The first is that I don’t have a use case for such a tool and the second is that, more so than previous Apple products, I fear how the Vision Pro can bring more harm than good to all-too-many people. It doesn’t seem as invasive as Google Glass but it promises, by design, to take people out of their immediate environment and I fear that will combine with surveillance and other exploitive tech to hurt so many people.

I can’t say I will never have the Vision Pro or a similar tool, to do so would just be foolish. I will just say that I will not contribute to the harm and physical piles of waste this first generation will generate. By the time such tech grows to the point where I have a use case for it I just hope I’m wrong about the harm it will cause but, only time will tell.
