Today was my first day back at work after taking last week off. There wasn't much to say about it. I had no meetings, no calls and just got to work on a ticket.

I need to take more time off like that. It really was a wonderful week.

Tonight we go to our first Chicago Fire game and I can't wait so at least it isn't too quiet of a week.

Here's to the next break.
