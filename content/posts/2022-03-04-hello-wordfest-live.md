This week I have the pleasure of working with the team at [Big Orange Heart][1] on [WordFest Live][2], a 24-hour, world-wide conference devoted to WordPress. I'm working with my friend Michelle Frechette as the speaker deputy helping her wrangle dozens of speakers spread over 6 continents into a coherent program to help educate the world on what WordPress is all about.

It's been 2 years since I last work with such a conference, the last time being WordCamp US in 2020 (which was cancelled at a relatively early stage due to COVID). To say I missed it is a bit of an understatement.

Before COVID I spent most of my time working with various WordCamps around the world. At some point I can see myself going back to a few WordCamps but, not as frequently as I did before. Instead I hope to branch out beyond WordCamps and WordPress in general with events more centered on my personal goals and values. WordFest Live is one such event. While still a WordPress event, it is put on by the folks at Big Orange Heart, an organization who's mission is to support the well-being of remote workers. Today I can't think of a tech organization with a more timely mission and I'm proud to help them push that forward.

I'm not alone in supporting Big Orange Heart but it takes an army to support such an important endeavor. If the well-being of remote workers is also important to you, please consider volunteering some of your time to the organization or one of its events. Your efforts will make the world a little better for all of us.
