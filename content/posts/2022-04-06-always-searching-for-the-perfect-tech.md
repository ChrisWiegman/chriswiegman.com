I've only been back on Mac for a few months and I already find myself looking at Linux machines again. On the one hand I tell myself I'm "just looking" but I realize it is that I really do miss working with Linux.

I'm at the same point with my phone. The iPhone is OK. It does what I need it to do. I still miss my last Pixel phone though that just seemed more intuitive and more capable in so many little ways.

Even the Apple Watch, which works OK for me, isn't as simple to use as my FitBit was. I'm constantly having to manually sync data to it from my scale and other apps and don't get me started on the constant charging. My last FitBit I would charge once a week. My Apple watch needs to be charged twice a day.

There are some things that really do work well with Apple. The device integration is far better than any alternative and I do enjoy not having to hunt for some app alternatives just to get a feature I need but that's really all I can say about Apple.

I used to get excited about tech. Those days are long gone. The trade off, however, is that the tech works for me and my family. Perhaps one day I'll find tech to be excited about again but, for now, I just need to live with what I have and find something else to capture my interest.
