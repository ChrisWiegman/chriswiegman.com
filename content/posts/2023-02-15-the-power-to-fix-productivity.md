If there is anything remote work should enable it's the ability to work wherever you work best. This isn't always true.

I've been remote for a decade now and I've gone through spurts where I am very productive and spurts where I can't find the energy to write so much as an email. While this is better than in the office where I could never be productive it is still not ideal.

Why is it a problem? I think it is because I don't have the freedom to move around where I would like. It's a problem I need to experiment with in the future.

I wouldn't go back to an office ever. I could literally never get anything done at any of the offices I worked in and was only productive when I could take a laptop elsewhere, away from the office. That said, it still isn't perfect. At least now I have the power to fix that.
