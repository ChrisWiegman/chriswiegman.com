We haven't gone out much over the past two years. I could still probably count the number of restaurants we've eaten at on my fingers (sans a little bit of travel). That said, we've been doing our best to take advantage of the current lull in COVID cases to get out and eat lunch with friends and family.

Yesterday afternoon we met a local Twitter friend for lunch up in Bradenton. A couple of weeks ago we met Joy's parents who took us for a lunch for her birthday and the week before that we got to eat with my brother's in-laws (in the picture on this post) who were in town helping her sister recover from a major surgery.

Overall I don't trust people in general and, especially, people in this area like I used to but getting out every once in a while has still been a very good thing for us. I do look forward to doing it more often, while it's safe to do so, with people we trust.
