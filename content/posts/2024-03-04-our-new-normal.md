This weekend was amazing, and all of it does seem to be becoming our new normal.

On Saturday we had an early birthday dinner for Joy (her birthday is today, 4 March) with both of her sisters and a couple we were close with in Carbondale yet hadn't seen since we left 12 years ago.

It was an amazing night.

Yesterday we enjoyed the amazing Chicago weather with a walk north down the lakefront to [the totem pole at Addison][1] and then down to Wrigley field and home. During our walk we even stopped for donuts this morning at a local place that easily beats any of the donut shops we had in Florida.

Tonight we're joining another close friend for Joy's actual birthday.

It's wonderful to have a life again.

It's wonderful to have places to go where we feel safe.

It's wonderful to enjoy the place we live, something we haven't really done since we left Carbondale.

I think this summer is promising to be amazing.
