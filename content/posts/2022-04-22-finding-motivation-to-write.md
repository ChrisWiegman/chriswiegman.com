I've written before on [finding topics to write about][1]. Frankly finding topics is the easier part for me as I have far more to write about than I can ever seem to complete. What I still struggle with, even as I've made a weekly habit of blogging, is actually finding the time to write about any of them.

Simply put, finding motivation for anything lately, including writing, has been anything but easy. Even this post is something I started on 3 different times only to start over when I couldn't find the motivation to follow through on any of the previous topics.

I'd love to say I have a good fix for this but I would be lying. Instead I want to open this up with a question: how do you find the focus and motivation to follow through on the projects and activities you love?
