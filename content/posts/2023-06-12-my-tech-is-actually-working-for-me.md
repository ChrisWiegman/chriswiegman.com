Last December I bought a laptop from [Framework][1]. I did so with two goals in mind. First, the immediate goal was to help make sure [Kana][2] would work with Linux and on that it was very successful.

The second goal was a longer-term goal to move back out of Apple and into Linux full-time as I was from 2017 to 2021. On that it has been a complete failure.

I’m not upset about this.

Tech, in general, is a trade off of shitty companies. As much as I would like to live in a utopia where I could avoid all of them, that is not going to happen. Today my workflow is far more efficient on Apple hardware and software than it has ever been and, more importantly, it all works together with my family.

If I did start the journey back to Linux I could only make it work with my family would be to go back to the Google ecosystem and I’m just not interested in that anymore.

What I am interested is building things and, for the first time in years, I think my current tech is well setup to do just that.

I can still avoid a lot of the worst of companies. I can still strive to use and build ethical, open, services. I now realize that I can do all of that just fine from my Apple hardware so that is, for the foreseeable future, where I’m going to stay.
