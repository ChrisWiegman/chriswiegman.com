The weekend is almost here.

I used to really look forward to the weekend but, anymore, weekends are just as pointless to me as every other day. In fact, in some ways they're even worse as I actually like what my work team is building and helping make that happen during the week is at least something good to focus on.

Weekends, however, don't bring much of anything.

If I'm lucky I'll be able to focus long enough to do some work on Kana. If not, well, I'll wind up not doing much of anything.

I really do miss the days where we had something to look forward to. I'm not longer sure that will ever be the case again.
