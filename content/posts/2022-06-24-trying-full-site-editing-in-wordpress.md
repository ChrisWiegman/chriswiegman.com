I spent some time this week trying Full Site Editing, FSE, in WordPress again.

I managed to get the default header removed but I couldn't replace it with anything. I made a descent go of the post layouts though.

I was trying to use it to reproduce the current layout of this site with its post list and not much else.

I failed.

What was most disappointing was that the page weight of what I did managed to get was nearly 1mb whereas this site is ~17kb. That is an amazing difference and really emphasizes so much of my frustration with similar no-code tools in general. Such waste is, in my opinion, a disservice to the web and a step in the wrong direction.

Hopefully, in a few years, the tool will mature and be more useful. For now, however, I'll stick with the theme I have.
