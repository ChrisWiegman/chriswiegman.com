January went by all too quickly. I had set out to try to update the theme on this site (again) and get ahead on my reading. As of today I'm about half way through the former and well ahead on the latter having finished 14 books in January.

As this month progresses I hope to get back into my groove, if you will, with my writing. While I've been getting posts out this past month, it is no secret that they haven't been my greatest work. Motivation and habit are two very different things and now I need to try to reconcile the two.
