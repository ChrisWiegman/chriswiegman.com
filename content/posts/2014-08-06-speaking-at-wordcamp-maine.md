I’m proud to announce that next weekend, August 16th, I’ll be speaking at the inaugural [WordCamp Maine](http://2014.maine.wordcamp.org) in Portland, ME. I’m really looking forward to interacting with a younger WordPress community and sharing some of what I’ve learned about more advanced security topics in my talk “[Securing Your Code: WordPress Security for Developers](http://2014.maine.wordcamp.org/session/securing-your-code-wordpress-security-for-developers/).” If you’re in the area [come on out](http://2014.maine.wordcamp.org/attend/), there is plenty to learn and plenty to share.
