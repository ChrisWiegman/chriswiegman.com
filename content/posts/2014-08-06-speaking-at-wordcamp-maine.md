I’m proud to announce that next weekend, August 16th, I’ll be speaking at the inaugural <a title="WordCamp Maine" href="http://2014.maine.wordcamp.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WordCamp Maine</a> in Portland, ME. I’m really looking forward to interacting with a younger WordPress community and sharing some of what I’ve learned about more advanced security topics in my talk “<a title="Securing Your Code: WordPress Security for Developers - WordCamp Maine" href="http://2014.maine.wordcamp.org/session/securing-your-code-wordpress-security-for-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Securing Your Code: WordPress Security for Developers</a>.” If you’re in the area <a title="WordCamp Maine Tickets" href="http://2014.maine.wordcamp.org/attend/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">come on out</a>, there is plenty to learn and plenty to share.
