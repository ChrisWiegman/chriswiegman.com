This week I hit a milestone, for the first time in memory I made it three months without a single soda.

I drank my last soda, a 24oz bottle of Mountain Dew, on Halloween and promised myself then that that would be the last one. It's one of the harder personal challenges I've done in a long time as I am thoroughly addicted to soda. Unlike giving up beer or other changes I made I still really miss it.

I've come a long way since the days where I was flying for Pacific Wings and could go through a full 24-can case of soda in a single day. That said, until Halloween I was still drinking way too much of it.

I don't know how long I'll be able to keep this win up but, I'll take it for what it is while I can.
