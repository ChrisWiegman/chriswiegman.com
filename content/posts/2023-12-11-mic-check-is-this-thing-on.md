After a very long Fall (full story to come in a future post) I feel like I'm finally in a place to start blogging again.

When I wrote my last post, just over 2 months ago, I was burned out and so very tired. Today life looks a lot different. I often feel like I'm holding myself back in my writing due to not having time or a belief that I'm "not ready." It's time to stop that and move forward.

I'm very, very glad to be back.
