I've had [my current WordPress theme][1] on this site for longer than any previous theme or site design I've used...

...and I'm thinking of changing it again.

While it's served me well I actually find myself wanting to explore some newer technologies with WordPress and that just doesn't work with a theme where the goal was to be as efficient and sustainable as possible.

Removing all the JavaScript and so many other little things I don't _need_ is neat but the modern web doesn't work that way. If I want to explore how to build a site with WordPress in 2023 I need to embrace Gutenberg and other tech and that will simply require a much, much more bloated theme.

Beyond the tech, I'm just finding the design itself dated. I'm used to changing this site every few months at least and I think I first launched this theme over 2 years ago. I've had a few ideas wandering around in my head and I would like a new coat of paint.

We'll see where I go with this in the coming weeks and beyond but I'm actually a bit excited to have something to do with it. Now to see where that leads.
