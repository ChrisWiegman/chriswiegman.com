As I start planning to return to the office later this week I want to make a change.

For years I've been what you might call "extremely online." I was glued to social media, first to Facebook then Twitter and, lately, Mastodon. While I would say that my engagement has gotten healthier over time it is still too much.

I'm tired of the petty fights, the gaslighting and the gatekeeping.

I'm tired of purity tests and tiptoeing around conversations because I hold beliefs, even if not relevant to the conversation, that differ from someone else.

I'm tired of being "extremely online."

At one point I think I somehow believed that my arguing or presence online was going to change any of that. I've long since abandoned that ideal. Rather than putting my energy into actual activism and assistance I've stayed online, arguing, endlessly scrolling and generally lost.

No more.

I don't know what this is going to look like, yet. There are still many advantages to me being somewhat active on social media. That said I know it won't look like what it used to and I'm OK with that. I need to push forward, not carry on as I have been.

Wish me luck.
