This weekend I got to do something I haven't done in a while, work on [Kana][1]. While I haven't pushed a new release yet it was yet another reminder of how much I really enjoy working on such projects when I have the energy to do so.

So what will Kana become? I have no idea. So far it's simply an outlet for me to experiment with and build the WordPress development environment I always wanted for myself. There are a few users, and I'm very grateful for that, but I suspect my own ideas of dev are probably a turn-off to most in a market where the biggest features seem to still revolve around launch time and speed to load the site, even if far more time is lost on those same tools due to how difficult they make it to actually work with code.

In a world that is speeding as fast as it can to ensuring everything that mentions WordPress should be built in JavaScript Kana is, to me, proof that things can be done better and that there is room for quality tools that, rather than see how quickly they can load a site, look at the site itself and see how it can better handle a project. Given that I don't much care if it gets popular or not. I'm building it because I simply enjoy building and using it and, frankly, that's enough for now.
