May is about over, and not a moment to soon.

It's been a busy month for us. We've been to a Cubs game, a White Sox game, a Chicago Dogs game and a Chicago Fire FC game. We went to the Field Museum and the Lincoln Park Zoo. We spent weekends at my father's house, hung out with Joy's sister and even made it to our first Meetup in 5 or more years. It's been crazy.

On the flip side, we found out we're getting a $24,000 special assessment against our condo for building work they're doing. Joy's sister found out she's losing her job in the coming weeks and plenty of things seem to have broken over the course of the month.

It's funny, over the winter I wondered if we would be bored here in Chicago. This month, however, has been one of the busiest months in memory.

Here's to seeing what June will bring.
