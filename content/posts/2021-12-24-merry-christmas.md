Today is Christmas Eve. While I'm not the most religious person, and come from a family that is anything but religious, Christmas has always been my favorite holiday. There's just something wonderful about it all.

If you do celebrate, Merry Christmas to you and yours.

If you do not celebrate, Happy Holidays!
