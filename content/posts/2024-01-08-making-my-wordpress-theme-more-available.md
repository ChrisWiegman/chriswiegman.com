I've had numerous requests for copies of this theme since I launched it a while back. I can point folks to the code but that's not always usable, especially if you're not a developer.

This past weekend I took steps to fix that by making a complete zip of the theme available on GitHub via [this theme's release page.][1]

It won't auto update (at least for now), but you can download it and use WordPress' upload theme option to install it like any other theme.

In the future I would like to work to make it a little more user friendly and a little less tied to this site as a whole with some of the templates and all. I'm not there yet, but I'll get there. At that point maybe I'll even try to get it up on wordpress.org as an example of a very lightweight theme that still looks great. We'll see.

For now if, like me, you just want to write and don't need all the newer features to manage your site's design in WordPress it's a great option that will give you a very fast blog that is amazingly easy to maintain. In 2024 what else can we ask for?
