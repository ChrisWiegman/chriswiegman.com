I've been writing here three times a week for 15 months now. As much as I would like to say it gets easier, I would be lying.

I've written about this before but I really do believe it deserves repeating.

Writing is hard.

Don't write because you have to, but because you want to.

Write to get better at writing.

Write to have a record of who and where you were.

Write to empower others.

Write for the fun of writing.

The second you feel you have to write your audience will pick up on that, as many of you have pointed out to me at times over the past 15 months. My posts will never win book deals or awards but they're my posts and I love writing them.
