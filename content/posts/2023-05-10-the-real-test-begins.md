Joy went home yesterday morning. We wanted to leave separately so we didn't just all leave my dad at once. She drove home with her sister and took the pets with her.

I'll go home the 21st.

Then the real test for my dad, who has never really lived alone, begins.

I can't fathom having to go through all that. I'm just grateful I've been able to be up here for all 6 weeks to help him begin to transition. After this my brother isn't too far away but it won't be the same.
