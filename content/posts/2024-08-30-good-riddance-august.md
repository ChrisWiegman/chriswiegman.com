August, by any measure, has been an incredibly rough month for me.

Thanks to my work schedule my exercise has gone to near zero, my diet has gone to shit and my drinking hasn't ended. All of these I need to fix.

The first two items on my agenda are to quit drinking again next month, something that circumstances have made harder than I had anticipated, and getting back to walking 10,000 steps/day. That will be a big start.

Then I start layering more in on top of that as I go forward.

Wish me luck! I'll need it.
