Today is a wellness day at work. The company implemented them after going remote-first with the pandemic as a way to help prevent excessive burnout while everyone is working from home.

For me, it's a blessing. I don't take a lot of days off simply because, anymore, what would I do with the time? As such, an extra day here and there is so very welcome and appreciated. With a little luck I'll make some progress on a few projects I've been thinking of for this site and finish reading another book or two.

It's going to be a wonderful weekend.
