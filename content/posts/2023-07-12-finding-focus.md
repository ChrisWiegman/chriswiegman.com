It's been a very long year. The more I try to focus on anything, including this site, the more I find any level of focus nearly impossible.

I miss the days of being able to write 500-1000 words. I miss sitting down and focusing on a story rather than what amounts to little more than a social media post.

I don't know what it's going to take for me to get back to that point. I just know I want to continue to try to do so and that it won't be easy.
