It's Sunday as I write this, two weeks from today is Christmas, the only holiday I even notice anymore.

I don't know what it is about Christmas that still captivates me at my age. I think it's a combination of the memories of the only holiday we regularly celebrated as kids, the start of winter (especially since I've been living in Florida) and the chance for a little rest. Whatever it is, it is the one holiday I look forward to every single year.

If there's anything disappointing about Christmas for me it's the day after the holiday. So much anticipation is just over all too quickly and then the dredge of the new year starts again.

Oh well, today marks two weeks until my favorite holiday of the year and, at least for today, that makes me very happy.
