Today is my last work day before a 10-day vacation. While it's actually the shortest holiday break I've taken over the last few years, it is needed more than any have been in a long time.

I'll continue to write next week and I look forward to some down time and just getting ready for a 2024 that I really hope will be far better than 2023 was.
