On Sunday morning the temperature should be right about freezing here in Sarasota, a rare feet for an area should be averaging a low of about 52F/12C this time of year.

While it doesn't compare to winter in Chicago or anywhere else up North it is, nonetheless, noteworthy for the area.

Personally, I cannot wait. These are the rare few weeks each year where I love the weather where I live.

Oh how I wish it could be like this year round!
