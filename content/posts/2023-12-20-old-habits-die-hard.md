If there is one thing I've really regretted this year it is that I started drinking again.

It wasn't really a planned thing. It happened as a bad coping mechanism after my mom passed in April. That's not really a great excuse but, after years of total sobriety, it is what it is.

I tried to end it again this Fall but our "move from hell" kinda nixed that. Turns out there's a really great spot for a Guiness next to our place and, well, that's been the easy way, all too often, for me to leave the house. As a result I'm there once or twice a week which, if you know me, is far more than I want to have any alcohol.

I committed to stopping again on 1 November, that lasted a week. I tried again on 1 December with a similar result.

Now I need to get serious about it. I want 2024 to be a year of getting healthier so, here I am, again, committing in public that I will no longer drink in 2024.

There is so much to replace it with here too, much more than we had available to us in Florida anyway. The difference here is everyone else we know here drinks, most of them a lot more than we do. How I navigate that is going to be tricky.

Wish me luck.
