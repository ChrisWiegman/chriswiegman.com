We spent the weekend at our parents' houses. On Friday we went to my father's house where we drove up to Milwaukee for lunch on Saturday and went to one of his favorite spots, The Brat Stop in Kenosha, for lunch yesterday.

After lunch we drove out to Joy's parents' house and went to dinner with both of them for Father's Day. Her sister Jen even joined us.

I still have to remind myself that this is why we moved to Chicago. This was the first Father's Day we were able to spend with our dads in 25 years and I am very grateful for it.

For me, Father's Day leads to some rather complex emotions. I'm just grateful we could make it a good one for both of our fathers.
