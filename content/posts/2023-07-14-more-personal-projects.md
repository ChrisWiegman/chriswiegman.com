I've so enjoyed working on personal projects that I find myself starting more and more of them.

Last week I built [gh-backup][1], a tool to make it easy to backup all of your public GitHub repositories.

This week I've started a WordPress plugin and another Go utility, both of which you'll hear more about when I get them a little bit further.

I've started working on yet another design refresh for this site.

I've been working on plans for another WordPress plugin to make WordPress a better tool for static sites, which basically describes what this site really is anyway.

These projects make coding fun again, something I've so missed. I can't wait to show you more as I get them even further.
