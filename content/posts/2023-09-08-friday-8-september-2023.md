It's been another long day for me as I write this. Lately, at least since I stopped writing all my posts on the weekends anyway, that seems to be more of the rule than the exception.

I dream of one day being able to escape to a place where I can write, unencumbered, for hours on end. At one point in my life I was able to do that and I loved every second of it. Today I just often find it too difficult to summon the energy or the words and that really bothers me.
