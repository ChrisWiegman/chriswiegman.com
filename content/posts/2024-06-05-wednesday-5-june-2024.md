I wish I had a longer post today but, alas, that is not the case.

We were able to spend yesterday afternoon hanging out with a friend we hadn't seen since before COVID. It was a wonderful afternoon but, by the time we got home, I just didn't have it in me to write.

For us I think it was a great tradeoff.
