The one place in this house where I've always felt comfortable is my office. I've spent the last 9 years building it up to almost exactly where I want it (I still can't stand the terrazzo floors) and that is one thing I'll be sad to lose.

In our new place I'll have a smaller office, billed as a dining room, for office and I'm sure I'll make that into my space as well but, as I begin to take my current office, it is making me more sad than I thought it would.

Oh well, here's to onward and upward.
