This weekend I head back to Florida and, I hope, that means I'll be able to focus more in general.

I've fallen behind on a number of things over the past few weeks and I'm hoping that being back in my office will help me regain some of that focus.

I also hope this will be one of the last times I'll have to call Florida "home" when returning from a trip. One can dream, right?
