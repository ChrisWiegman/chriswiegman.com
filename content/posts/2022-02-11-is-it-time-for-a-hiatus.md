When I started blogging regularly back in July I did so with so much to write about. For months I managed to keep the posts interesting and helpful, at least enough to grow some traffic anyway.

Since December or so I feel like that's changed. Today I'm struggling for topics and words. As a result, the posts of the last few weeks have been anything but valuable.

I think it might be time for a break.
