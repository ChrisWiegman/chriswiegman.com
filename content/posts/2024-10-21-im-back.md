It's been a hell of a few months but I feel like I'm ready to start writing again.

A few of the highlights, both good and bad, since I was gone:

*   Joy and I celebrated out 17th wedding anniversary
*   I was promoted to Vice President of Engineering at work
*   I moved this site back off of WordPress and onto Hugo
*   I decided to quit drinking again this month
*   I've retired most of my WordPress projects
*   Due mostly to a massive change of diet and lifestyle with my new company I crossed 200lbs again

I'm sure there's more, and each of those will cover a full post or more in the coming weeks.

For now, with the exception of my weight, I'm finally feeling pretty good about my life and where I'm at with a lot of things. Now I just need to find ways to better structure my time and my energy to make things happen.
