We all have our favorite software packages, and for all of us that list is directly affected by what we use out computers for. In my case I spend my computer time working on websites and trying to find better ways for my company to get things done. With that said I’ve definitely found a few apps I couldn’t do without:

**1.) <a href="http://www.firefox.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Firefox</a>:** This is without a doubt where I spend most of my time whether working on my sites or researching a new program. I had been a big fan of Internet Explorer for years, but now with Firefox 3 and the Foxmarks extension I don’t see how I could ever go back.

**2.) <a href="http://www.syncplicity.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Syncplicity</a>:** I primarily use two computers interchangeably. For the last 2 years I had been carrying an external hard drive around with me. Now with Syncplicity I don’t have to worry about that anymore. Everything is synchronized automatically between my computers without me lifting a finger or worrying about forgetting my drive somewhere.

**3.) <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">7-zip</a>:** With large amounts of files I always find myself archiving old projects to both save space and help me keep organized. 7 zip beats everyt

hing else I’ve tried for this in speed and resource utilization, and best of all, it’s free.

**4.) <a href="http://filezilla-project.org/index.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FileZilla</a>:** As a web developer I couldn’t do my job without a good FTP client. I’ve tried a good number of clients over the years, but now I always find myself going back to Filezilla.

**5.) <a href="http://office.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft Office</a>:** I’ve used office for years and even with new software such as OpenOffice I just can’t seem to pull myself away from the old standby.

**6.) <a href="http://www.gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GMail</a>:** GMail is another new addition to my collection. While not a local app, it’s ability to allow me access to all my email regardless of what computer I use is simply un-beatable.

**7.) <a href="http://www.ccleaner.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CCleaner</a>:** I wish I didn’t need a cleaner for Windows, but with all the software I test and all the computers I support CCleaner just makes my life a little easier.

**8.) <a href="http://www.adobe.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DreamWeaver</a>:** I’ve tried alternatives, but with it’s truly unique built-in FTP features I just can’t get away from using this old standby to hand-code all of my websites.

**9.) <a href="http://www.adobe.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Photoshop</a>:** There are some good free image editors such as GIMP, but none of them can combine the ability to edit both raster and vector graphics.

**10.) <a href="http://www.digsby.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digsby</a>:** Before finding Digsby I had used Trillian and Pidgin for some time. What finally made me switch is the ability to synchronize accounts and setting over multiple computers. As often as I reformat computers this feature alone will keep me from using anything else.
