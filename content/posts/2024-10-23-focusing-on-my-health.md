I’ve seen a lot of changes in my life over the past few months but none of them have had as much of an impact as going back into an office.

At one point I said I would never do it, then we moved to Chicago. Throughout our time in Florida one of our biggest issues is that we knew so few people. Working at home was great for a lot of things but building a core group of friends and networking was not one of them.

We _like_ our life in Chicago. I don’t want to repeat that mistake so, at least for now, I’ve gone back to working in an office and I confess that with an easy commute (it’s 1 15-minute bus ride from literally our front door to about 100 meters from my door for work) and being around people again I’ve enjoyed the change.

What has not enjoyed the change is my scale.

In 3 months I’m up about 15lbs, crossing 200lbs for the first time since around late 2020 and I look and feel it.

Catered lunches and overly-available snacks combined with a change in my exercise habits are showing and, at least for the moment, I don’t know how to change that.

I’m trying to get back to walking daily but the change in weather means sinus issues which means, on mornings like today, I don’t get to walk much at all.

I’m trying to avoid snacks and all at work but that has only been partly successful.

Something has to change, I just don’t know what else to do with it right now. For the foreseeable future, however, fixing this will be my primary goal.
