Every time I bring up the [Drupal][1]/[Joomla](http://www.joomla.org/ "Joomla") argument I can guess at what any Joomla user’s argument will be: “Joomla is more popular in [Google Trends](http://www.google.com/trends "Google Trends").” While this is undeniably true it is neither an indication of the quality or capability or either system nor is it the only metric by which to measure their popularity. Take a look at the Compete.com graph below for an example:

![Site Comparison of joomla.org (rank #27,478), drupal.org (#26,856) | Compete](/images/2011/04/Site-Comparison-of-joomla.org-rank-27478-drupal.org-26856-Compete-350x300-1.png "Site Comparison of joomla.org (rank #27,478), drupal.org (#26,856) | Compete")

While this is just one of many metrics that doesn’t prove anything about the quality of the software, perhaps I should site it more often…
