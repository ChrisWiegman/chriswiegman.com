Well, all my devices are updated to the latest Apple OS versions.

For the most part this all went pretty smoothly, at least compared to some prior years anyway. I did, however, wipe my personal computer and do a clean install rather than trusting the upgrade process as I find it nearly always causes issues to just upgrade.

With that I should be done messing with my tech for another year. At one point I really enjoyed the constant tinkering but those days are long gone. Today I'm more worried about what I'm doing with the tech than too the tech and I'm perfectly OK with that.
