If there has been one trend I cannot escape this year it is that these posts are getting ever shorter. It's not an accident, but it's not intentional either. If anything I think it comes down to the fact that I can just never feel comfortable to focus on writing anymore.

At one point I used to be able to find a quiet corner somewhere and focus for hours on code, a post or whatever project I was working on at the time. This is how I built nearly everything I did at Southern Illinois University where I would leave my office and settle into a corner of the library or student center for half a day or more where I could focus solely on the work at hand.

Today I simply cannot do that anymore. I can't focus on really anything in my living room and, after work, I just want to get out of my home office. I try to ignore it but all I have to do to see the effect is look at this site.

I like to think moving will solve it and it isn't more of a deeper problem but I really don't know if that will turn out to be true. In the meantime I'll keep trying to focus on, well, anything really and maybe I'll eventually find a technique that will work.
