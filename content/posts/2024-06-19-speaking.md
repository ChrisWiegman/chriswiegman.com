Last night I had the privilege of speaking at the [WordPress Naperville Meetup][1]. It was my first time speaking at all since 2022 and my first time speaking in person since 2020.

Oh how I missed that.

I've had many titles over the years. The title I'm always most proud of is "teacher." Speaking, whether at conferences or Meetups, is where I get to exercise that skill and interest today. I'm not a story teller. I'm not one to show off future tech. I'm a teacher and I want to help those who listen push their own work further. That is the rewarding part.

Maybe I should have looked for a career in developer relations instead of regular product development. That might have helped me exercise my love of teaching more. For now, I was just grateful to be back in front of a group and talking about a topic that I've long been involved in.

Last night's talk wasn't even a new one for me. It was WordPress security, a topic I've spoken on for over a decade. It was the perfect way to get back into the spirit of speaking.

For those so inclined, you can find my slides from last evening [here][2].

Now to plan a few more talks for the future.
