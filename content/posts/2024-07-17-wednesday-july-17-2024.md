I'll get caught up on my writing, at some point. Yeah, I've been saying that for a while but I think I really have a chance for a change.

The catch is, for the moment, that readjusting to an office has been a challenge. While I'm finding the ability to separate work and play a bit easier I just don't have the energy to work on a laptop when I get home, for writing or otherwise.

I'll get there, though. Of that I am certain.
