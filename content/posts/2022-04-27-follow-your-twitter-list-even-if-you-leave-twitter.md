There's a lot of people leaving Twitter this week thanks to the service being sold to Elon Musk. The worst part of this, for a lot of people, is losing track of accounts you follow.

Thankfully, there's a really old solution, RSS, that works with all the feed readers from FreshRSS to Feedly and more.

How does that apply to Twitter?

Now there's an easy way to discover the feeds of everyone you're following. [Twitter OPML Export][1] crawls the profiles of those you follow and grabs all the feeds pulling them into a nice little OMPL file you can then import into your favorite feed reader.

[Check out the tool here][1].
