If there is anything my minimal return to travel as of late has taught me it is that my home office has just become too complex.

Don't get me wrong, it was fun putting it together and I do use most of the devices in it but, when it comes right down to it, I don't need most of that _stuff_ and can actually be more productive without it.

I've said before that my best work was done when I had nothing but my laptop. I wouldn't even work at my official desk but instead I would find a chair in the campus library or a coffee shop and, damn I was productive that way.

These days I normally work at a fancy desk with all kinds of gadgets on it. Not only are those things unnecessary (if I'm honest I redid the office for something to do in the age of COVID) but they're also _stuff_ that will simply make moving difficult.

I'll be home in a few weeks and I don't know, yet, what I'll do about this problem but the longer I'm away from home the more I recognize it all for the problem it is. Now for the fun part of trying to come up with a solution.
