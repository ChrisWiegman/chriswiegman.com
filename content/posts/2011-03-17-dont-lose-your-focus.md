Providing regular content on your site isn’t easy. It’s even more difficult when you write targeting a specific audience such as web folks or higher ed folks. Just because it isn’t easy to come up with new content however doesn’t mean you should let your focus wonder.

If there is one thing I’ve learned over the last 3 years of this blog it’s that people read it for a reason. They’re looking for something specific and if they like it they will look for related content. As such have too many posts that stray from your main theme, no matter how much fun they seemed like at the time, will turn people away no matter how well they’re written. Readers of a tech don’t care what you had for dinner last night or about your latest holiday photos. They care about your tech writings.

If you want to blog on more than one topic don’t be afraid to start a second blog. [WordPress.com](http://www.wordpress.com) and other sites can be a great resource for allowing you to express yourself without turning off your readers.
