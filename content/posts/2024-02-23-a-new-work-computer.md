Last night's task: setup my new work laptop.

This machine replaces a 13&#8243; MBP from 2019 (i5 CPU) that was.... sub par... for much of what I needed to do with it. The new machine is a 14&#8243; M3 Pro. It only has 18GB of RAM but hopefully that will be enough for me as I don't code for work anymore.

If I had my way I would only use 1 laptop for everything. I absolutely hate the hoops I need to jump to to do all I need to do on a daily basis, especially since literally all of my work is in either Google Workspace or Zoom. At this point, though, I've mostly just given up.
