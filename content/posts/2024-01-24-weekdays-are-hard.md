If there is one thing that hasn't change after our move it is my energy level after work on weekdays. Most days it is simply zero.

In some ways this isn't a bad thing. During work I spend my days highly engaged and very busy.

On the other hand I find it almost impossible to write longer blog posts or to work on [Kana][1] or to really do much of anything.

I don't know what the answer is to this. It's not a "new" problem nor is it something where any solution will be easy. That said, I know I want to find the energy to work on things that are important to me and, I hope, this year will be the year I figure out something.
