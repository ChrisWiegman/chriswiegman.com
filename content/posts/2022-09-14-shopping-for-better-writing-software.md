For the last year I've been drafting the posts you read here directly in WordPress. It's not ideal, but it's the only way I've found that works with the new block editor.

While it works I've found the editor in WordPress difficult to use, resource intensive on my computers (my M1 iPad Pro with 16GB of RAM struggles with it) and all around to be not the best writing experience. If I was working with new layouts on each post or doing anything else particularly "fancy" with it I would be forced to continue but, I'm not.

Lately, as you've probably noticed, 90% or more of what I write is just paragraph text and a couple of headings. This means that, for 90% or more of my posts I should be able to draft them outside of WordPress without issue. It's time to start doing that.

In the past I've found [ByWord][1] to be decent and I'll give it a fresh look but I'm also going to take this time to explore other alternatives as well. I'm only writing from my Mac and my iPad and I'm not writing particularly long posts so, I hope, my needs are simple. It's time to start shopping.
