As I write this it is Tuesday night. That means I have two more work days until the holiday break. I cannot wait.

I do love my job but I am ready for the break. From working on this site to working on [Kana][1] I have lots of grandiose plans for the next week. While I doubt I'll finish them all I can't wait to give it a shot.
