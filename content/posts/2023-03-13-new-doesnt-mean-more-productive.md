I’ve been writing, lately, from a host of devices including my Macbook Pro, My [Framework][1] laptop (with Fedora 37) and my 12.9” M1 iPad Pro.

Of all the devices I write with, I have to say that I think the iPad, with a good external keyboard, is quickly becoming my favorite. It’s fast, stable and has all the tools I need to focus on the writing and not get distracted with other tasks.

I’m kinda surprised by this. I really thought, at least when I got it, that the Framework laptop would be my favorite writing device. It is a good one but not being able to access so much of my data (I have most of my data in iCloud currently) really does hurt it quite a bit. The iPad, however, which I’ve struggled with elsewhere as I can’t use it for my main projects, my code, has turned out to be an absolutely perfect writing machine.

One of these days I’ll stop trying to add new devices to my workflow and I’ll learn to make the most out of what I have. Not only would it be lest wasteful that way but, honestly, I think that’s how I’m going to be my most productive with anything I want to do.
