Tomorrow I head back to Florida.

I'm hesitant to say I'm heading "home" anymore because it no longer feels like home. I hate saying that, but it is definitely true anymore.

With a little bit of luck I'm hoping it will be my last trip to Florida, maybe forever. We have a lead on a place in the perfect location for us in Chicago and next week we'll start seeing what we need to do to make that happen. With a little bit of luck perhaps we can even move this Fall.

That would be amazing.
