This week I've been reminded of why we moved back to Chicago in the first place...

Family.

Last night we went to the first in-person WordPress Meetup we've attended in 4 or 5 years. This was mostly to help my sister-in-law who found out, just last week, that the WordPress agency she's been working for is shutting down. I'm hoping I can help her network and get involved with a group that might lead to some job opportunities.

Instead of heading home we came out to my father's house last night. Today is his birthday, the 2nd time my mom passed and the 1st we've been able to celebrate with him in decades.

Chicago might never have been on our radar as a place we would want to move back to but it is being able to do things like this that has absolutely made it worth it.
