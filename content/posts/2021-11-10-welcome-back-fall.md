Fall has arrived on the [Florida Suncoast][1] and not a minute too late.

Some people get seasonal depression in the winter. For me, since moving here, I get it worse than I ever have and I get it during the summer. Summers here can last from roughly April to November but, thankfully, this weekend we've gotten a nice break.

For the first time since April or so it makes me feel like I'm actually alive. I want to be outside and do things again and it's so very wonderful a feeling.

The eagles love it too. The cover picture for this post is one I shot on our walk last Sunday morning of a Bald Eagle on top of our local water tower.
