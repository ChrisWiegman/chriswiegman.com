In April my role changes and I go back to being a developer (Sr. Staff Software Engineer, to be specific). As it's been 2.5 years since I last wrote code for the day job I've been thinking about what that means for me this time around.

First, I've kept up on code with my own website, [Kana][1] and a host of other side projects so I'm not overly worried about that. What I haven't done, however, is have much reason to learn some newer tech that simply doesn't apply to my side projects.

## JavaScript

I know some JavaScript as I've used it for years. What little code I wrote as an engineering manager is even typically in Node.js. What I've never had a reason to learn or use is the newer JavaScript libraries and other tech like TypeScript, Next.js and others.

My new role will keep me in [Atlas][2] and there will still be plenty of opportunity for me to get my hands dirty with this type of code. I'm kinda looking forward to that part.

## More Go

Most of my side work, especially Kana, is written in Go. I love working in the tech but what I'm building doesn't have need of some more of Go's more advanced features. We have a lot of services written in the tech at work and I'm hoping this will be my chance to up level my own skills.

## Python

I've dabbled with Django and some other Python over the years but I still think that the most I've ever done with the tech was way back during my computer science classes in university. For a lot of what most folks would turn to Python for I've usually just used Node.js for no other reason than easily accessible libraries and familiarity with the tech itself. I hope to find more reasons to dig in deeper now.

## Rust

Finally, I really want to learn Rust. We don't use it at my company so I really haven't had a chance to dig in. That said, I have a few ideas for side projects where I think it might really be a good fit.

In the end, while reverting to a developer role wasn't my choice, it is absolutely something I want to make the best of. I actually look forward to work days that aren't spent in meetings and a chance to focus on engineering problems again. After all, when life gives you lemons, make lemonade, right?
