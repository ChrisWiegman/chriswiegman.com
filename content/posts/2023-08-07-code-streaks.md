I've managed to keep a commit streak going on [my GitHub account][1] for 3 weeks now. For a non-coding (at my day job) engineering manager I'm pretty proud of that.

I really do enjoy writing code, even after doing so for over a decade professionally. There are days I think I would like to do more of it for my day job as well but, alas, it just isn't in the cards for the foreseeable future.

Today I'm just grateful for projects like this site and [Kana][2] as well as a few others. They may not pay the bills but that's OK. They bring me something far more valuable and that is something I don't want to keep up.
