I’ve been [back on WordPress][1] for almost 2 and a half years now and I often still wonder if it was the right choice.

For all my efforts to make my peace with the Block Editor I really don’t feel like it is designed for writing. Of course all the news about it revolves around site layout but, even without that, it is still, at best, imperfect as a writing tool. I’ve only made it mostly usable to me by making darn sure I limit myself to a maximum of 4 or 5 blocks throughout this whole site. As soon as I try to expand to more things quickly become a bit of a mess and I get annoyed with the whole thing.

On the other end of it, there is still nothing better. I like the look of static site generators but I have little interest in using one again. They simply don’t account for managing content and that, now that I’m writing more often, is a show-stopper.

So where am I going with this? Nowhere really. I’m writing this post from my iPad and just wondering, once again, if WordPress is still the best platform for me and, at least for now, even with all its faults, I think it probably is.

As Mastodon is seeing a revival with a whole new generation of apps like Ivory, I do hope there’s room for a new generation of CMS tools that could rival WordPress for bloggers like me. I’m not interested in a static site generator but something that can manage structured content well and make it easy for me to share that content on a site I can appreciate. Maybe all the talk about a revival in blogging will lead to that, maybe not, but a guy can hope.
