The blank screen of the “distraction free” mode in the WordPress post editor has to be one of the most intimidating sights on Earth.

At least three times a week I face it, sometimes with an idea but usually not, and do my best to piece together a few thoughts relevant to my work or life.

I’ve long dreamed of being a writer, yet the post screen is often more than I can handle these days.
