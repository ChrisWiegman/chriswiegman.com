Another week has come and gone.

I managed to send off my passport renewal application. My passport expires at the end of this year so I need to get it renewed before we can do much with the visa process to move to Portugal. I sent it in with an expedited request but, looking at some forums and other places, I've seen folks waiting up to 6-8 months for even the expedited US passport renewal. Unfortunately this isn't going to be a quick process but, at least it's a process that is underway.

I've also been getting much better at writing my posts over the weekend these past few weeks. I find, when I do so, I tend to write more about tech and WordPress and less personal posts and I don't think that's a bad thing. I'm writing this particular post on Thursday evening, the day before I plan to publish it, and while I don't mind doing it this way I do think I do better by planning these writings out a weekend (or more) before I plan to publish rather than just the day before.

For the writing itself I will say that I do appreciate the new "[Distraction Free][1]" writing mode that arrived last week in WordPress 6.2. It finally offers me a truly blank canvas for writing and, while I haven't used it a whole lot yet, I think it really will improve my blogging experience here.

I think that's about it for this week. I'm starting to feel excited that we may, finally, be getting out of Florida and that is helping my mood in a lot of ways. I wish I could speed it up but I'll take what I can get.
