My parents have left and our house is back to the status quo.

For some I realize visitors can be stressful and that can be true for me but I also love time with family. I think this is why I largely look so forward to Christmas every year.

For now, though, the visits are done and we have nothing but quiet time for what is left with the year. I'm OK with that, but it is a bit sad. Here's to a better next year.
