Yesterday marked one full year since the day that changed everything for my family, the day my mom didn't wake up.

I still miss my mom every day.

If you had told me, on the morning of 7 April last year, that today my life would look the way it does I would have told you you're crazy. From my mom, the youngest of our parents, being gone to moving to Chicago none of it was in the cards for us yet... here we are.

I don't regret the move. It got us out of Florida and I think that's a very good thing. I just wish it hadn't come with such a cost.

Here's to hoping this next year is far less memorable.
