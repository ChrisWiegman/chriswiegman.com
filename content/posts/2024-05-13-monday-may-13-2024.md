Our weekend was so full of activities that I didn't even have time for a post.

We started Friday afternoon/evening with a [Chicago Dogs][1] baseball game. It was their opening night and we went with quite a bit of family. It was a blast.

Saturday afternoon we went to a Chicago White Sox baseball game. We hadn't been to one since 2005 so I had bought my wife the tickets for this one in March. They won and it was a great time.

Yesterday we say my wife's parents for Mother's Day and took them to lunch.

I'm not used to getting out of the house this often so, today, I'm tired. Here's to hoping for more fun-filled weekends in our future.
