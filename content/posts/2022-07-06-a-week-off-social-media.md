Today has been a full week since I signed off of social media.

I've tried signing out before and I always wind up returning within a few days. Either I have someone I want to talk to, something I want to read about or a post I want to share. This time I've managed to avoid all of that and it feels good.

How do I know it's helping? On Monday, the 4th of July holiday here in the US, I managed to actually watch a full movie and two episodes of a TV show. It has been months since I did so without browsing Twitter while watching and it felt damn good.

I can't say I'm feeling any better about the state of the world around me, yet, but it's a start.
