A few weeks ago I believed my fortune was changing and I would have the bandwidth to write more.

Now I know I was very, very wrong.

I think it might be time to put this blog on hiatus until such a time that I can give it proper attention. My current situation is such that I can barely enter receipts, much less take the time to write here.
