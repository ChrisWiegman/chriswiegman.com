If there is one truth to the past couple of years it is that my side projects have kept me from losing my mind.

They've been an outlet for creativity, a distraction to focus on and they have been meaningful exercises in the type of code I simply love to write. As I no longer code for my day job, side projects have helped me maintain the love for tech that brought me over from aviation way back before I even knew what WordPress was.

Like anything, though I sometimes wonder if it is worth keeping my various projects going. While I code for myself these days, and don't much care if anyone uses the code I write, I still tend to wonder "why" all too often and, when it comes down to it, I do have three reasons why I keep them going.

## Side projects are a way for me to be creative

We have few other hobbies anymore and, as a result, my code is the one place where I feel like I can really express myself. I don't need to write a masterpiece or make a million dollars with them, I simply need them to form and mold software that I _want_ to use. No one paying me means I can build tools to do exactly what I want them to do and that is a pretty great freedom to have.

## Side projects keep my skills up

Beyond just being a creative outlet, side projects do serve to help me keep my coding skills up should I ever need them again.

My current role as an engineering manager means that all my time goes into efforts beyond code. While that can be rewarding in and of itself I came to tech to write code and my side projects help me make sure I can still do that. Who knows, given the tech economy anymore that might come in very handy at some point in the future.

## Side projects are fun

Most of all, for me side projects are just fun. I don't want them to be a "side hustle" or my future job. I want them as a distraction from the day-to-day and, in that, all my side projects have been exactly what I've needed, especially these past few years.

I've tried to turn my side projects into work a few times and it hasn't usually worked out well. These days that's just fine. Building a project for the sake of building a project is just what I've needed lately and I really hope I can keep that as my only reason for them for many years to come.
