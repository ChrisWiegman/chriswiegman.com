Over the coming weeks I may, finally, hit a milestone I haven’t been able to accomplish in quite some time, I may actually launch a personal project.

Ever since the DevKit project ended at WP Engine I’ve been in search of a good development environment for WordPress sites. While I don’t believe my needs are ridiculous, I haven’t been able to find a tool that really works for me so, for the last few months, I’ve been building my own.

I don’t want to release all the details yet as it isn’t done (if I’m lucky I get to work on it a couple of hours a week so I have a little ways to go yet) but I really think this could be a winner for those of us who want a simple CLI tool for WordPress development.

What makes it different? It’s basically a combination of the simplicity of wp-env combined with a few features such as custom domain names, sites on default ports and a few goodies to allow themes and plugins to actually be 1st-class citizens for development all in a package that shouldn’t require something as ridiculous as Node to run it.

It’s been fun, and I’m looking to open this up to others it might help. That said, I don’t intend it to become the massive endeavor some of my previous projects have turned into. It’s simply a way for me to enjoy building something for a change and that, at least so far, is exactly what I’ve been doing.
