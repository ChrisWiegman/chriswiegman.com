In December [I bought a new Framework laptop][1] to use with Linux. The goal has been, and still is, to use it as the first piece to eventually replace my Apple stack with something more open and sustainable.

Two months later that project has gone no where and that’s OK.

I have this habit that, when I start something, I need to finish it right away. While I know time is our most important resource I find myself so reluctant to invest it in anything resulting in so many unfinished projects. When I get frustrated, rather than hunker down and invest the time it takes to solve a problem, I typically back away and never come back.

It doesn’t have to be this way.

Yes, my Apple tech works for me today.

Yes, my Linux laptop is great for coding on the various projects I’ve been working with.

The two statements do not mean I need to shift everything over to Linux today nor do they mean that I’ve failed for not having done so already.

Instead it means I need to step back and take the time I need to make the change happen.

One day I’ll learn this lesson.
