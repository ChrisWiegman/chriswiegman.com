If there is anything I struggle with lately it is finding the energy for this and other side projects after work.

For as long as I've been remote I've worked hard to keep consistent and predictable work hours. This means I schedule myself from 8:00 am to 4:00 pm and do my best to get everything done during these hours.

For the most part the hours work well. I'm grateful for a job that doesn't require more and, thankfully, I rarely find myself working after hours or on weekends. It happens, but it's rare.

The problem is that my days are intense enough that, after 4:00, I can't bring myself to work on anything else. The evening could be prime time for [Kana][1] or other projects but I just don't have the energy.

Most evenings I mindlessly browse the web on my iPad until 8:00 pm when I go to bed and read for an hour or two (bed is, lately, the only place I can read).

I really want to change this pattern but I'm stuck. I simply don't know how. As much as I would like to say otherwise I can't will extra energy into existence so nothing moves forward. My goal, as March approaches, is to find a way to change this.

Wish me luck.
