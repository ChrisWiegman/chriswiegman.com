Some days are easier to write for me than others. At the top of the "other" list is Thursday.

I don't know if it is just because of a lack of energy or what but I really struggle to write these posts when, like today, I wait until Thursday to write Friday's post.

When you know your strengths and weaknesses it is usually a good idea to use that information. During this past year that has been hard for me and it is something I need to fix.
