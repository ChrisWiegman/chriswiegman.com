On Saturday we took the plunge and put in an offer on a condo that popped up for sale on Friday. We found out yesterday morning that our offer was accepted.

This means we'll be moving to Chicago quicker than I really thought possible. Right now I'm both excited and terrified. We should be closing October 3rd and it's all moving so fast.
