Happy Thanksgiving to all my friends and family.

It's been a long and stressful almost-two years for all of us but here's to hoping you have something to be thankful for in your own life.

As much as I've been rather depressed this past year, I do have plenty to be thankful for in my own life. Here are a few such things that are most important to me:

I'm thankful for our new nephew who was born this past August to Joy's sister and brother-in-law.

I'm thankful for our own health. Staying home so long has been hell on both of our mental health but we've made it through together and today we are, in many ways, stronger for it.

I'm thankful for good jobs that have allowed us to finish off all debts sans our mortgage this past year. As a bonus we re-financed our mortgage to a new 30-year mortgage which we should have done in 4-5 years. We've done this all while still building our savings for retirement and anything else that might come up.

I'm thankful for my friends who have been there for me this past year, especially Michele Jones, Michelle Frechette, Taylor Waldon, David Johnson and so many others who have put up with my shit and still are willing to chat daily.

It's been a rough two years, there's no doubt about that. That said, there have been these bright spots and more that I wouldn't change for anything in the world and that, more than anything else, I am truly grateful for.
