Last July [I re-introduced analytics to this site][1] for what I thought would be helpful insights to help guide future posts.

It hasn't worked out that way.

After 6 months of chasing analytics I'm not using them for anything other than vanity. I check multiple times a day to see who has visited, where numbers are, etc and nothing translates back to the content I'm writing.

This is, to me, the wrong way to do this. As a result I've removed analytics from this site entirely for now and will simply continue to focus on the content itself, not on the views that don't mean anything.

We all get off track at times. Last year I knew analytics were a problem yet I still felt that I was missing something and went down that road anyway. It's time to go back to what I know is right for me and for you.
