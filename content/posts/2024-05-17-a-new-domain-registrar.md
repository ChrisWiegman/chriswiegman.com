I had been happy with Gandi for quite some time. I moved there after Hover "lost control" of one of my domains costing me the domain altogether and have also used Google Domains, Namecheap, GoDaddy and others in the past.

Last year Gandi was bought out and it has not gone well for users. Prices have gone through the roof and I was just tired of it.

This week I decided to do something about it. After talking with quite a few folks I've moved all the domains I could to [Porkbun][1] and I'll be saving a couple of hundred dollars a year as a result.

The only catch is my .li domains, a TLD that Porkbun currently doesn't support. I bought some alternative TLDs for both, for now, and I'll move them over if Porkbun supports them or I'll just let them expire. Not really a huge deal at this stage.

As for the transfer itself, it went really smoothly. I transferred 3-4 domains at a time so I didn't lose track and the whole process took me about 2 hours without, from what I've seen so far, any issues.

I'll call that a win.

If you're looking to get off of Gandi as well I do recommend giving Porkbun a shot.
