The past few weeks have been a struggle. From writing to side projects and pretty much everything else the motivation I was so excited about a month ago is just gone and I don't know what to do to get it back.

I guess this is pretty obvious by my writing lately. On that note I'll probably take a break for a bit until I can find my voice again.
