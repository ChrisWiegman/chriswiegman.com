It's been a while since I've been able to give a talk anywhere, too long in fact. With in-person events still unable to be done safely I've been looking for more podcast and virtual events to talk at but, so far, I haven't been getting too far.

It's not that I can't find the events, it's more that I really don't seem to have anything I want to talk about. Topics that excited me just, frankly, don't anymore and I don't even know where to start it seems on anything new.

If I do nothing else for the rest of 2022, I need to find ways to talk and teach again. WordPress, privacy, self-hosting, developer tools... I feel like there are plenty of things I can do, now I just need to find something I want to do.
