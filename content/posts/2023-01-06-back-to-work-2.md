I'm back at work this week.
For the most part I'm usually grateful to get back to work after the holidays and, while I am this week as well, I also confess I could've really used another week off.

In previous jobs I didn't get the holidays off at all though, so I really cannot complain.

As my team ramps up to build new features and push forward I'm excited for our potential for this year and looking forward to what we can accomplish together.
