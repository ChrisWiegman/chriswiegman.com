One thing that has come back this year is our bad habit of going out for beers after a bad day. We need to change that.

The healthiest year I've ever had was 2022. We exercised every day, I didn't drink at all, I lost weight and I just felt better.

That all changed when my mom died last April and, so far, we haven't done well at getting back on track. I don't like it.
