The thing I loved most about conferences, when I was still going to them, is teaching. While getting up on stage in front of people has actually always scared the hell out of, sharing what I can with an attentive audience more than made up for it.

While I've tried a few online presentations over the past two years they just don't compare with the chance to teach in person. It is the one thing I feel like I've really lost throughout the pandemic.
