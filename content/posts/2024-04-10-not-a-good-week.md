This week, as I write this, is the first anniversary of my mom's very unexpected passing.

It's also, I hope, the conclusion of the house sale from hell which has ended so badly that the selling price is so far below every realtors' "worst case scenario" that the difference is more than the entire selling price of our previous home that we sold in 2012... and that's before the $12,000 we had to spend on repairs over the last few weeks to replace all the perfectly-good electric because the buyer's insurance says it isn't new enough.

It's also following the layoffs/reassignments of the team I managed for the last 2.5 years and the end of my management role. It wasn't due to the team's performance (they also ended a team with a far bigger project) but... damn.

The last two nights have been nothing but really bad nightmares.

I'm so done with all of it.
