I really need to find a way to focus. The other week I was able to for a whole afternoon and I was able to write to good (at least for me) posts for my week. Today I did my best to recreate those conditions and I failed miserably.

On the one hand I know I shouldn’t care. On the other I know I’m searching for something I don’t think I’m ever going to find.

In either case I’ll think about those moments when I was able to sit and focus with something like a bit of awe.
