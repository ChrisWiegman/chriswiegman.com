If you know me well you know that my new job has not been without its struggles. I don’t know, yet, if I can overcome those but I’m trying to focus on the good parts, of which there are also quite a few.

First, I’m no longer bored. I think pure boredom had been a big cause of my burnout since DevKit ended at WP Engine in 2019. No matter how hard I tried to get away from WordPress I just couldn’t escape it and that lead to some very boring projects. I found my footing when I took over the Faust.js team as Engineering Manager but even that couldn’t last and the team was disbanded last March leading to me finally moving on. After I lost my team I was right back to boredom and life is just too short for that. I want to build things. I want to push forward and get things done, not sit and wait while maintaining a tech I don’t care to work on.

Next, I’m creating again. While my new job is as a non-coding engineering manager the fact I work for a start-up means I’ve needed to get very creative in a host of different things. Sometimes I am writing code. Sometimes I’m dealing with images or videos or PowerPoint presentations… the list goes on.

While some of that might seem mundane it’s been a very long time since I could really be creative with anything at work and I’m loving it. That is one very big plus for where I find myself today.
