If you're the praying type, please do so for my town today.

If you're not, any good vibes you can send are welcome.

My neighborhood is due to take a direct hit from a very strong Hurricane Ian this evening and it does not look good. The area has never had a hit like this before and many homes (including my own) and businesses are not built for it.
