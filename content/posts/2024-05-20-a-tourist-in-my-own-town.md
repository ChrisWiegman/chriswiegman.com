I have the week off of work this week, it's a much-needed break after an extremely stressful period.

Normally we would travel during a week off and, indeed, we considered it. In the end though, we're staying home and we're going to explore as tourists around Chicago.

It's been 25 years and a winter since we've really explored the area much, other than the local zoo and a few places we can easily walk to. In a city as rich as Chicago that, at least to me, is almost a travesty.

We're starting our week today with a trip to the [Field Museum][1]. We're heading to my father's house tomorrow for his birthday and then hope to head either to the [Brookfield Zoo][2] or the [Chicago History Museum][3] on Thursday and, hopefully, we'll then meet a friend for a bit in Grand Rapids, MI on Friday.

Beyond that, we'll see where we wind up but I'm already excited!
