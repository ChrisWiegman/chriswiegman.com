![But I Thought there Were No Core Bugs in WordPress?](/images/2013/05/wordpress-logo-150x150-1.png)

There have been a lot of posts lately talking about how secure WordPress core is and how so few vulnerabilities have been reported over the last few years. [WPEngine had one that became very popular a few months ago](http://wpengine.com/2013/05/wordpress-core-is-secure-stop-telling-people-otherwise/ "WordPress Core is Secure - Stop Telling People Otherwise - WPEngine") and I’ve seen numerous others. I’ve even written myself on how [WordPress problems are not necessarily in the code but are instead a result of education and the human element of WordPress](/2013/05/notes-and-observations-on-wordpress-security/).

That said, [WPDaily has an infographic this morning talking about WordPress security](https://torquemag.io/2013/07/security-infographic/) where they list a full 32% of WordPress vulnerabilities as being in core and 40% in plugins and themes. While I don’t have the time to really look into this claim this morning I still find their numbers quite intriguing especially coming on the back of [WordPress 3.5.2 which patched seven vulnerabilities itself](http://wordpress.org/news/2013/06/wordpress-3-5-2/ "WordPress 3.5.2 Maintenance Release - WordPress.org").

**So which is it? Is WordPress secure or isn’t it?** Considering [my plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/better-wp-security/ "Better WP Security") I’m not going to elaborate on my thoughts. _I’m more interested in what you think. Lets talk about it in the comments below._
