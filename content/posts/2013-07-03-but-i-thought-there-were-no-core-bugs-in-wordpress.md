There have been a lot of posts lately talking about how secure WordPress core is and how so few vulnerabilities have been reported over the last few years. <a title="WordPress Core is Secure - Stop Telling People Otherwise - WPEngine" href="http://wpengine.com/2013/05/wordpress-core-is-secure-stop-telling-people-otherwise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WPEngine had one that became very popular a few months ago </a>and I’ve seen numerous others. I’ve even written myself on how <a href="/2013/05/notes-and-observations-on-wordpress-security/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WordPress problems are not necessarily in the code but are instead a result of education and the human element of WordPress</a>.

That said, <a href="https://torquemag.io/2013/07/security-infographic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WPDaily has an infographic this morning talking about WordPress security</a> where they list a full 32% of WordPress vulnerabilities as being in core and 40% in plugins and themes. While I don’t have the time to really look into this claim this morning I still find their numbers quite intriguing especially coming on the back of <a title="WordPress 3.5.2 Maintenance Release - WordPress.org" href="http://wordpress.org/news/2013/06/wordpress-3-5-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WordPress 3.5.2 which patched seven vulnerabilities itself</a>.

**So which is it? Is WordPress secure or isn’t it?** Considering <a title="Better WP Security" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/better-wp-security/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my plugin</a> I’m not going to elaborate on my thoughts. _I’m more interested in what you think. Lets talk about it in the comments below._
