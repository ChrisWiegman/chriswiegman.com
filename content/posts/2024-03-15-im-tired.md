I'm so tired, so very, very tired.

Everywhere I turn is just more bad news affecting friends, family, work and everything else and it is really getting to me this week.

It feels like we've crossed some sort of critical point and there is no more return to anything better.

I'm just tired of all of it.

I'm just tired.
