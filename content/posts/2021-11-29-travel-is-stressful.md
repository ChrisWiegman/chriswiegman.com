On Saturday we returned from our first trip to see family in almost two years. It was both wonderful and one of the most stressful things I've done in a long time.

This wasn't our first trip of COVID. In June we drove to Cape Canaveral for a weekend away and in September we drove to Ithaca, NY for the wedding of some of our favorite people. This past week was, however, our first flight together of the pandemic. In addition, I've spent so little time around people that being in a room with 4 or more people for a week was simply overwhelming.

I'm still glad we went. We got to take family pictures with my family, meet our new nephew (he was born this past August) and spend a holiday meal with someone other than our cats.

I don't know what 2022 will bring. While we have some grand plans starting to take shape this past week also reminded that I'm not sure I wish to go back to a life of constant travel. Instead [it makes me want to try harder to build a life that simply doesn't require being constantly on the road for happiness][1]. I don't know when of if that will happen but, at least we have a new North Star for our own lives and some plans to start making that happen in 2022.
