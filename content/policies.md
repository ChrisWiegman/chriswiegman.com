## Income Disclosures

__I am occasionally paid for reviews of products or services__. In these cases I will clearly mark the review as such so as not to confuse any of my readers. In addition, as compensation for these reviews is often in the form of free product as a way to get the product in question to me for a review, any income from such reviews will never sway my opinion of the product in question.

__I participate in affiliate programs__. Some links on this site are displayed as part of affiliate programs for which I am compensated should a click on the link result in a purchase of the product or service in question. Note that I only use affiliate programs for products and services I currently use or have used myself and can recommend to the public in good faith. Your mileage may vary.

While this site is in no way designed to make me rich, it does have the requirement of being, at a minimum, financially self-sufficient. My efforts to make it so do not however reflect in the opinions I express.

## Privacy Policy

This site uses no JavaScript or analytics of any kind. All server logs use anonymous IP addresses and are discarded every 48 hours. Server logs are in place simply to help me find and troubleshoot problems that may arise with the site.

Some embeds may rely on code from from third-party sites. Where I use such code I will call out a link to the 3rs party's privacy policy as appropriate.

As you may have noticed, there is no contact form on this site. Emails sent to me via the contact email address are stored in an encrypted format on my email host and will be deleted upon the conclusion of our business. If you would like to encrypt your email to me in transit, you may do so using my [http://wieg.co/pgp](public key).

## Code Credits

As for the design of the site itself, inspiration and code came from a few places. The idea of an archive site and homepage layout was taken from [https://ar.al](Aral Balkan). Most of the rest of the layout is from the [https://github.com/vividvilla/ezhil](Ezhil) Hugo theme which is also what I used as a base for the markup itself. Finally, most of the responsive work, especially the menu, came from [https://gitea.chriswiegman.com/chriswiegman/chriswiegman-theme](my own WordPress theme) which powered this site up until last year.
