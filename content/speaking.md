Writing great code is only part of the equation. Teaching others to write their own code not only helps others succeed in their own goal but also is one of the most fulfilling activities I’ve ever done. Fortunately I’ve had the opportunity to speak and teach to diverse audiences on WordPress and other technologies over the years.

I am available for speaking engagements at events, conferences and other in-person activities to talk on security, technology, building a product and professional development.
